<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RUNNING THE ADVENTURE</head><p>To run this adventure, you need the D&amp;D fifth edition core rulebooks: <ref type="bibr">Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual.</ref> The Monster Manual contains stat blocks for most of the creatures found in this adventure. All other necessary stat blocks are included in appendix A. When a creature's name appears in bold type, that's a visual cue pointing you to its stat block in appendix A or in the Monster Manual. If a stat block appears in appendix A of this book, the text tells you so.</p><p>Spells and equipment mentioned in the adventure are described in the Player's Handbook. Magic items are described in the Dungeon Master's Guide or, in the case of new items, the encounters in which they are found.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AREA DESCRIPTIONS</head><p>Undermountain is a series of interconnected dungeon levels, each one deeper than the last. Every dungeon level has its own encounter locations keyed to a map.</p><p>The adventure text often presents the most important features of a location in the form of a list with boldface headings for ease of reference. These key features are arranged in order of prominence or in the order in which characters are likely to notice them. These summaries are designed to help you process the information at a glance. If a listed feature requires further explanation, you'll find additional information about that feature after the summary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ABBREVIATIONS</head><p>The following abbreviations are used in this product:  <ref type="table" target="#tab_75">The Levels of Undermountain table lists the dungeon's  levels and the character levels for which they're designed. It's okay for characters to enter a dungeon level  that's designed for a higher-level party; the encounters  there will be more dangerous</ref>  Each dungeon level contains enough monster XP to ensure that characters who clear out the level can advance to the point where they're ready to take on the challenges of the next level down. You can also award XP for overcoming traps and for exceptional roleplaying with key NPCs. The Bonus XP Awards table provides recommended XP awards for such interactions.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_75">Blackcloak (see appendix A) journeyed from a distant  land to the base of Mount Waterdeep, perhaps acceding  to the whispered summons of providence. Some believe  he hailed from the nearly forgotten empire known as  the Cradlelands. In ages past, humanity spread from  the Cradlelands across FaerOn, originating from what  is now the Plains of Purple Dust, a wasteland</ref>   <ref type="table" target="#tab_75">When the elves left, they used a powerful spell  to erase all traces of their capital. This spell had the unintended side effect of creating a permanent knot in the  Weave, the fabric through which all magic is channeled.  This knot lies deep underground and isn't something that  can be seen, felt, or undone, but it can cause madness  to bloom in the minds of mortal beings who dwell</ref>  came to surround the ruins of Halaster's home. Undermountain was known to those early settlers, and they often sent criminals into its endless depths as punishment. So it was for many years, until an intrepid adventurer named Durnan delved into the labyrinth beneath the tower and returned alive, laden with riches and countless harrowing tales. Durnan used his new fortune to demolish the remnants of Halaster's tower and built an inn over the well he had used to descend into Undermountain, and call it the Yawning Portal. Durnan owns and operates the inn and tavern to this day, serving patrons and inviting the brave and foolish alike to test their mettle in the Dungeon of the Mad Mage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BONUS XP A WARDS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE YAWNING PORTAL</head><p>The Yawning Portal, a famous inn and tavern located near the eastern slope of Mount Waterdeep, derives its name from a 40-foot-diameter well that descends into the first level ofUndermountain. Located in the center of the taproom, the well was once the outer shell of Halaster's mighty tower, which was demolished long ago. Its sheer walls are made of old mortared stones. Next to this gaping orifice hangs a winch with a simple rope-and-pulley mechanism that Durnan, the proprietor, uses to lower adventurers down the shaft and (sometimes) pull them up again. Durnan controls the winch himself and will transport only one adventurer at a time. The trip takes 10 rounds, down and up. The rope is stained with old blood and long enough to reach all the way to the floor of the dark room at the bottom of the 140-foot shaft (level l, area 1).</p><p>Durnan charges adventurers 1 gp each to descend into the well, whether they opt to use the rope or not. The return trip also costs a piece of gold, sent up in a bucket in advance. He a lso readily accepts coin from patrons who want to place grisly bets on adventurers who dare explore Undermountain, and their odds of returning alive. "Five gold dragons says they're back before a tenday, minus the fighter, the wizard, and the cleric!" is the flavor of commentary often heard amid gales of drunken laughter.</p><p>The walls of the well are crumbly but have abundant handholds and footholds. They can be scaled without climbing gear with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. No check is needed to enter Undermountain by using the rope-and-pulley system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ADVENTURE HOOKS</head><p>Adventurers who hang around the Yawning Portal often find work delving into Undermountain on the errands of others. The characters might have their own reasons for venturing into the Mad Mage's dungeon, but the adventure hooks described in this section can be used as further motivation. These hooks are divided into two categories: starting quests and future quests. Adventurers are under no obligation to accept or complete any of these quests, though the promised rewards are often substantial enough to be tempting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STARTING QUEST~</head><p>Starting quests are available to characters from the outset of their experience with Undermountain. Any of the quest givers described below might approach the characters shortly after their arrival at the Yawning Portal. The characters can accept as many or as few starting quests as they want. Based on the needs of your campaign, you might even introduce some starting quests of your own.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HUNT FOR MAGIC ITEMS AND SPELLBOOKS</head><p>Obaya Uday, a neutral good Chultan priest of Waukeen (god of trade), has traveled from the distant city of Port Nyanzaru on behalf of a wizard named Wakanga O'tamu to procure magic items from Waterdeep. When she learned about Undermountain, Obaya booked a room at the Yawning Portal in the hope of hiring adventurers to plunder the dungeon of its magical riches.</p><p>Obaya approaches the adventurers and offers to pay for any unwanted magic items they find in Undermountain. Obaya has secured her funds in Waterdavian banks and can pay handsomely within a matter of hours for any magic items the characters bring to her. The amount s he's willing to pay is based on the item's rarity, as s hown in the Magic Item Rewards table, and is nonnegotiable. Characters would be hard-pressed to find anyone willing to spend as much for these items as Obaya is, and she always pays in platinum pieces for ease of transport.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">5 pp for 1st level, 25  pp for 2nd or 3rd level, 100 pp for 4th or 5th level, 250  pp for 6th or 7th level, and 500 pp for 8th or 9th level.  Once she has paid for 7,500 pp worth of magic items  and spellbooks, Obaya hires a small squad of bodyguards, books passage on a merchant ship heading to  Chult, and returns to Port Nyanzaru with her trove.</ref> PAY A HARPER DEBT A lawful good bard named Mattrim Mereg, known as Threestrings to his friends, plays a three-stringed lute at the Yawning Portal and is a much more talented musician than he pretends to be. In truth, Mattrim is a Harper spy who uses this busking gig to establish relationships with the Yawning Portal's unique clientele.</p><p>Mattrim needs a pouch of gold delivered to a female half-drow named Cal'al Claddani, who runs a tavern called the Flagon and the Dragon in Skullport. Cal'al provided shelter a nd healing to a wounded Harper spy in Skullport and is owed payment for her support. Mattrim's pouch contains three moonstones worth 50 gp each.</p><p>Once they deliver the pouch, characters can take refuge in a Harper hideout called Dalagor's Fortress, located on the uppermost level of Skullport. Mattrim tells the characters that a dragonborn mage named Felrax guards the place.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SEARCH FOR KRESSANDO ROSZNAR</head><p>A young noblewoman, Esvele Rosznar has been frequenting the Yawning Portal on busy evenings, keeping mostly to herself while sipping zzar and listening to gossip. Her family has a tarnished reputation, having once been banished from Waterdeep for slavery and other illegal acts. Although the Rosznar family is trying to regain its integrity and standing, several bad apples threaten to impede that progress with their sinister ventures. Esvele's brother, Kressando, was sent to Skullport to conduct secret meetings with the Xanathar Guild and gauge interest in setting up a s lave trade in S kullport, far from the eyes ofWaterdavian authorities. Esvele didn't learn of this meeting until after Kressando vanished, and she is determined to stop his scheming and see him returned to Waterdeep before he can further tarnish the Rosznar name.</p><p>Esvele takes one or more of the adventurers aside as they prepare to make their initial descent into Undermountain and asks them to keep an eye out for Kressando, a 22-year-old man with fair skin and dark curly hair, trained in the arts of stealth and thievery. She also tells them that Kressando wears a platinum signet ring bearing the Rosznar family crest (a diving white falcon on a field of blue) and an inscription of the family motto ("Fly high and stoop swift").</p><p>She promises that if the characters can facilitate Kressando's safe return or deliver proof of his whereabouts to Esvele, she will owe them a favor, adding that "You can trust in House Rosznar." (For more information on Esvele Rosznar, see Waterdeep: Dragon Heist.) <ref type="bibr">UNDERMO</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THRONE OF THE CORONAL</head><p>Volothamp Geddarm, famous explorer and raconteur, offers to buy the adventurers a round of drinks to celebrate their upcoming expedition into the Dungeon of the Mad Mage. Injected into the conversation is the following tale:</p><p>This story dates to the fall of Illefarn, an elven kingdom of the North. An alabaster throne belonging to Syglaeth Audark, the last coronal of Illefarn, disappeared from the capital city of Aelinthaldaar, where the Mad Mage built his tower and today stands Waterdeep. It's said that a group of dwarves feared the destruction of such a miraculous work of stonecraft and stole the throne right out from under the elves' slender noses. Where the dwarves hid it for so long, who knows? But should you find it in Undermountain, it would please the elves of the North to know it survives.</p><p>In truth, the ancient alabaster throne was spared the destruction of Aelinthaldaar by Coronal Audark himself, who ordered it placed in an underground vault. Despite the precaution, the throne was damaged in the calamity that befell the elven kingdom. After the fall of lllefarn, Melairkyn dwarves found the throne and bore it to their halls with the intention of repairing it and returning it to the elves.</p><p>If the characters find the throne (see level 3, area 14c) and inform Volo of its location, he s hares this information with his elf friends, who express their gratitude by giving the party a beautifully crafted longbow and an elven quiver containing twenty silvered arrows. The bow bears the Elvish inscription "Al hond ebrath, uol tath shantar en tath la/ala ol hond ebrath." This phrase translates to "A true friend , as the trees and the water are true friends." The elves eventually embark on their own expedition into Undermountain, with the goal of retrieving the throne.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FUTURE QuE_ ST _s __</head><p>Future quests are available to adventurers only after they satisfy the prerequisites. The characters might need to enter a nd leave Undermountain several times before they're eligible to receive these quests. Joroth approaches the characters in plain clothes and asks them to keep their eyes open for Falkir's Fist, a band of four dwarf adventurers that disappeared in Undermountain over a year ago. The leader of the band, Falkir Gravelfist, is believed to have stolen a famous emerald called the Eye of the Spider from the Mirabarran embassy in Waterdeep weeks prior to his disappearance.Joroth believes Falkir is dead (divination spells have confirmed as much) but would like to see the gemstone returned to its proper owners to strengthen political ties between Waterdeep and Mirabar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M ORE OF UN OER MOU NTAI N T O LO VE</head><p>Joroth describes Falkir as a particularly stout dwarf wearing a helm shaped like a boar's head. He says the gemstone is a spherical emerald roughly three inches in diameter, with a small imperfection in its core shaped vaguely like a spider. The gemstone has no magical properties as far as he knows.Joroth offers the friend• ship of the Lords' Alliance as a reward, which can be useful if one or more of tbe characters find themselves in need of assistance in Waterdeep or another alliance city.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prerequisite: 12th level or higher</head><p>Volothamp Geddarm introduces the characters to a friend of his: a young captain of the City Watch named Jalester Silvermane. If the characters played through Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, they probably know him already. Jal ester is a secret agent of the Lords' Alliance who reports to Lady Laeral Silverhand, the Open Lord of Waterdeep.</p><p>Unbeknownst to anyone but her closest confidants, Laeral's magic has begun to wane. She has researched a way to halt the decline, at least temporarily, but she needs a fragment of a magic crystal called the Runestone. The crystal was created by Halaster Blackcloak and secreted away in the depths of Undermountain. Laeral has sent jalester to hire a band of adventurers to retrieve a pebble-sized fragment of the Runestone, which he can then deliver to Laeral in utmost secrecy.</p><p>Jalester tells the characters that he wants the fragment for himself and won't disclose its purpose, except to say that its recovery will help to ensure Waterdeep's security (a true statement). He describes the Runestone as a large, glowing, disk-shaped gem with Halaster's rune floating in it. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SAVE THE DRAGON</head><p>Prerequisite: Complete the "Throne of the Coronal" or the "Eye of the Spider" quest Word reaches Lady Wylynd Moonstar, matriarch of the Moonstar noble family ofWaterdeep, that a party of adventurers has had some success in Undermountain of late. She learns all she can about these adventurers before sending her grand-nephew, a well-mannered half-drow named Helion Moonstar, to meet with them. Helion is Wylynd's heir apparent, and this mission is as much a test for him as it is for the adventurers.</p><p>Lady Wylynd is well over a hundred years old and senile, but she has never forgotten the dark blemish on her family's honor left by Vanrak Moonstar, who lorded over House Moonstar long ago. Vanrak and his small army of Shar worshipers fled into Undermountain to escape punishment for their many crimes in the city. It's Lady Wylynd's recollection that a longtime ally of the Moonstar family, a bronze dragon named Glyster, was asked or told to find Vanrak and bring him back to Waterdeep to face justice. The dragon found Vanrak but could not wrest him from the depths of Undermountain. Instead, the dragon became corrupted by Shar's magic and was transformed into a shadow dragon named Umbraxakar. In this evil form, the dragon fought by Vanrak's side for years, even serving as his mount from time to time.</p><p>Lady Wylynd believes it's her family's responsibility to free the dragon from Shar's evil grasp one way or another. She asks Helion to meet with the adventurers and convince them to find the shadow dragon in Vanrakdoom, one of the deeper levels of Undermountain, and break Shar's hold over him. Failing that, they should put the dragon out of his misery. In exchange for their help, Helion promises the friendship of House Moonstar, which comes with tangible benefits:</p><p>• Characters can trade magic items with representatives of House Moonstar, allowing free exchanges of magic items of similar rarity (subject to your approval). • House Moonstar offers to fund any future expedition the characters decide to mount, providing maps, cara• van services, and NPC followers as needed. • House Moonstar can put the characters in touch with people who can give special training (see "Marks of Prestige" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). </p></div>

Not all rumors are to be believed, however, and characters need keen ears and sharp insight to determine which stories have weight. Have each character make a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check or Wisdom (Insight) check. If the check succeeds, the character learns a secret about Undermounta in, and the player can draw a card from the Secrets Deck.</p><p>Players can hold onto these cards for later reference. When the characters meet an NPC in Undermountain who knows a fact, have one of the players draw another card from the Secrets Deck to determine what that NPC knows about Halaster and his dungeon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>jHESIYRA KESTELLHARP</head><p>Among the greatest of Undermountain's secrets is the story of jhesiyra Kestellharp, who was one of Halaster's most gifted apprentices until it became clear to her that Halaster was irrevocably insane. She fled, but Halaster dragged her back to Undermountain and trapped her in the Citadel of the Bloody Hand, a dungeon complex under Mount Waterdeep connected to Undermountain. Jhesiyra escaped her prison when its wards failed during the Spellplague. To hide from Halaster, she magically confined herself in the stones of Undermountain. She now exists in a bodiless state, inhabiting the very dungeon itself. Halaster is unaware ofjhesiyra's presence but also wonders over her disappearance following the Spellplague.</p><p>jhesiyra's plan is to use adventurers to defeat Halaster so that she can seize control of Undermountain.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_75">Jhesiyra can exert control over Halaster's magic gates,  keeping adventurers from passing through them if she  thinks they lack the might needed to defeat the perils beyond. In terms of game rules, characters are prevented  from passing through a gate when their experience level  fai ls to meet a prerequisite (the recommended character</ref>  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ALTERATIONS TO MAGIC</head><p>Halaster doesn't make it easy for creatures to enter or leave his dungeon. No spell other than wish can be used to enter Undermountain, leave it, or transport oneself from one level to another. Astral projection, teleport, plane shift, word of recall, and similar spells cast for these reasons simply fail, as do effects that banish a creature to another plane of existence. These restrictions apply to magic items and artifacts that have properties that transport or banish creatures to other planes as well. Magic that allows transit to the Border Ethereal, s uch as the etherealness spell, is the exception to this rule. A creature that enters the Border Ethereal from Undermountain is pulled back into the dungeon upon leaving that plane.</p><p>Magic that summons creatures or objects from other planes functions normally in Undermountain, as does magic that involves an extradimensional space. Any spells cast within such an extradimensional space (such as that created by a Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion spell) are subject to the same restrictions as magic cast in Undermountain. Spells can't destroy or alter the shape of <ref type="bibr">Undermountain's magically protected ceilings, pillars, columns, walls, or floors. For example,</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_75">an earthquake spell  would not trigger a ceiling collapse or create fissures in  Undermountain. Doors and furnishings, however, are  not protected in this way.  While they are in Undermountain, characters who  receive spells from deities or otherworldly patrons continue to do so. In addition, spells that allow contact with  beings from other planes function normally.</ref> SENDING SPELLS Inside Undermountain, Halaster can't be contacted by means of sending spells. Any cre ature that tries to contact him with a sending spell is magically redirected to the Mad Mage's nothic secretary (see level 9, area 31). Each time it is contacted in this manner, the nothic replies with a string of expletives in Undercommon. Other things the nothic night say (in Undercommon) include the following:</p><p>• "Are you alive or just waiting to be conjured?"</p><p>• "Get out of my extradimensional space!"</p><p>• "There's a knot in the Weave! I can't untie it!" • "Halaster's not home right now."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A RCHIT E CTURE</head><p>Undermountain is made up of a mixture of smooth, worked stone and rough-hewn s tone, with the occasional intruding natural tunnel or cavern. A few levels have exceptional architectural features; for example, level 16, the Crys tal Labyrinth, has walls, floors , and ceilings made of crystal. Rooms. A room's ceiling is at lea st as high as the room is wide, ofte n higher. If a room's ceiling height is n't specified in the text, assume it's the minimum height.</p><p>Tunnels. A tunnel's ceiling is as high as the tunnel is wide, unless otherwise noted. Most tunnels in Undermountain are arched and have no visible structural supports. Exceptions are called out in the text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DOORS A N D SECRET DOORS</head><p>Normal doors (including double doors) are made of thick, sturdy wood fitted with iron hinges and handles, and protected against moisture by magic. Secret doors are fashioned of the same material as the surface in which they're set (usually stone) and require a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to locate, unless noted otherwise. When they are closed, most doors and secret doors create airtight seals, keeping gases and gaseous creatures from passing through them; exceptions are noted in the text.</p><p>A one-way door can be manually opened only from one side (the other side has no handle or hinges). A knock spell or similar magic is needed to open a oneway door from the "wrong" side. Not many doors in Undermountain have locks, but those that do sport locks of masterful craftsmanship. When confronted by a locked door, a character with The Mad Mage makes his presence known throughout this adventure. Most often, he's a distant observer, watching with amusement as adventurers contend with the denizens and other dangers of his dungeon. Other times, he appears before them in the form of a spectra l eye or some other magical force. Why does he tolerate adventurers in his home? What's his aim? That's for you to decide.</p><p>This sidebar outlines several possible goals for Halaster. Choose one you like, or randomly determine Halaster's goal by rolling a d6. His goal can change at any time without explanation; he is the Mad Mage, after all.</p><p>Goal 1: Clean House. Halaster wants adventurers to clear out parts of his dungeon so that he can restock the tunnels with new threats from across the planes. He's unhappy about the amount of space the drow take up on levels 3, 10, and 12. He's also concerned that the conflict between the githyanki on level 16 and the mind flayers on level 17 could spiral out of control; consequently, he wants one side or the other (or both) eliminated.</p><p>Goal 2: Destroy Ezzat. An irksome lich named Ezzat has taken refuge on level 20, and Halaster wants adventurers to destroy the lich and its phylactery. Halaster has bound two genies (a dao and a marid) to level 19 and uses them to help adventurers accomplish this goal.</p><p>Goal 3: Strike Fear into Heroes' Hearts. Halaster wants fewer adventurers coming down the well to pester him and steal his valuable belongings. To that end, his goal is to terrify adventurers and send them screaming back to Waterdeep with horror stories that discourage others from descending into Undermountain.</p><p>Goal 4: Become Waterdeep's Shadow Lord. The Shadowdusks were Waterdavian nobles who descended into madness, taking refuge in Undermountain. Halaster wants to return them to power in the city above and use them as puppets to rule Waterdeep from below as its Shadow Lord. Adventurers can thwart Halaster's scheme by destroying the leaders of the Shadowdusk family and laying waste to their stronghold on level 22.</p><p>Goal 5: Find an Apprentice. Halaster is searching for one or more new apprentices worthy of his time and tutelage. He is cultivating talent on level 9, but he's also paying close attention to other arcane spellcasters who enter Undermountain. Of course, once the novelty of new apprentices wears off, Halaster will likely do the same thing he's done with all his previous apprentices: teach them ways to mutilate and destroy themselves.</p><p>Goal 6: Locate Jhesiyra. Somewhere in the back of his twisted, paranoid mind, Halaster believes that Jhesiyra Kestellharp is still alive and plotting to destroy him. He has no clue where Jhesiyra might be, but he can't rest until the mystery of her disappearance is solved and she's his prisoner once again. Halaster thinks he can use the adventurers to lure jhesiyra out of hiding, but they turn out to be the same adventurers she's using to find and destroy him.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPANDING UNDERMOUNTAIN</head><p>Each dungeon level has tunnels that lead off the edge of the map <ref type="table" target="#tab_75">. These tunnels can be ignored if you have no  desire to expand the dungeon. If you choose to expand a  level by creating new rooms of your own, you can attach  your section of the dungeon to an existing map by using  one of these connecting tunnels.</ref> another attempt on the same door unless it has another creature or a tool (such as a crowbar) to assist.</p><p>If the direction in which a door opens becomes important, decide for yourself which area the door opens into.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ELDER RUNES</head><p>Elder runes are ancient symbols imbued with magical power. With years of study, any creature that can cast the symbol spell can learn an elder rune and add it to the selection of symbols that can be created with the spell. Halaster has spent lifetimes studying elder runes, inventing new ones, and harnessing their volatile magic. He likes to place them throughout Undermountain as hazards.</p><p>Appendix B presents several elder runes on paper cards that you can photocopy and cut out to create an Elder Runes Deck. When circumstances call for the appearance of an elder rune, a card is drawn from this deck to determine which rune appears and what it does.</p><p>Elder runes function as symbols cast using the symbol spell, with these changes:</p><p>• An elder rune has two possible effects: one beneficial (called the boon effect) and the other harmful (called the bane effect). The elder rune's creator chooses which effect occurs or can randomize it so that a die is rolled to determine whether the bane effect (odd die roll) or the boon effect (even die roll) is triggered. • A triggered elder rune targets one or more creatures within 60 feet of it, according to the caster's specifications. Once the effect activates, the elder rune disappears and the spell ends.</p><p>A creature doesn't make a saving throw against an elder rune's boon effect. Saving throws made to resist the bane effect of Halaster's elder rune have a spell save DC of 22.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GATES</head><p>Ha laster creates magic gates that a llow instant travel between levels of the dungeon. He can also create gates that lead into and out of Undermountain, which he uses primarily to restock the dungeon with monsters. His old gates were destroyed by the Spellplague, but Halaster has replaced them with new ones, most of which have destinations confined to the dungeon. These gates are not s ubject to the restrictions outlined in the "Alterations to Magic" section.</p><p>Opening a gate in Undermountain usually requires a s pecial key, the casting of a spell, or some other act. Halaster likes to leave clues to help adventurers solve each gate. A legend lore spell or s imilar magic can also reveal the proper way to open a gate. <ref type="table" target="#tab_75">An open gate acts as a two-way portal and typically  remains open for 1 minute upon activation. Creatures  peering through the open gate can see the destination  beyond as though they are looking through an open  doorway into that location.  A gate can't open within the area of an antimagic field  spell or similar effect. Dispel magic has no effect on a  gate, but a wish spell can permanently destroy a gate or  force it open for up to 1 hour. A gate cannot be damaged  or destroyed otherwise.</ref> Halaster favors three kinds of gates:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>UNDERMOUNTAIN OVERVIEW</head><p>Arch Gate. This gate looks like an archway chiseled into a blank wall. The archway is 10 feet high and 10 feet wide unless otherwise noted. Most of the gates in Undermountain are arch gates.</p><p>Mirror Gate. This gate consists of a wall-mounted mirror, ovoid or rectangular, encased in a carved stone frame. The mirror is 10 feet tall and 5 feet wide unless otherwise noted. All the gates leading to and from level 10 are mirror gates.</p><p>Standing Gate. This gate forms between two standing stones or pillars. Unless otherwise noted, these columns are 15 feet tall and spaced 10 feet apart, with a stone lintel resting horizontally atop them to form a rectangular opening. Because the gate is freestanding, one can pass through it from either direction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ELDER RUNES ON GATES</head><p>When a gate opens, a random elder rune appears within its vertical plane. Draw a card from the Elder Runes Deck to determine which rune appears. Halaster usually has the rune target the first creature that passes through the open gate. Every so often, to keep the players guessing, you can have the rune trigger when the second or third creature passes through. Once an elder rune is triggered, it vanishes until Halaster recasts the symbol spell on the gate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ILLUMINATION</head><p>S ince the creatures that originally carved out Undermountain had darkvision and Halaster lights his way by using magic, a reas of the dungeon are unlit unless otherwise noted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A VISIT TO A LTERDEEP</head><p>If your party of adventurers is incapacitated or killed in Undermountain, you have an unusual option for keeping both them and the campaign alive: the characters could awaken in an alternate version of the Yawning Portal that is part of a psionically generated simulation ofWaterdeep called Alterdeep, created by the ulitharid on level 17. If you choose this option, the characters are stabilized, brought to level 17 of the dungeon by mind flayers or their thralls, and placed in capsules called psipods. While unconscious and trapped in these psipods, th e characters are immersed in the ulitharid's realistic simulation ofWaterdeep. Over time, they'll notice inconsistencies that suggest they're not where they appear to be, and they'll have chances to converse with the ulitharid in its many guises and convince it to set them free. For more information on Alterdeep and its ulitharid creator, see level 17.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LEVEL 1: DUNGEON LEVEL HE 0UNCEON LEVEL IS DESICNED FOR FOUR</head><p>5th-level characters, and characters who defeat the monsters on this level should gain enough XP to reach 6th level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WHAT DWELLS HERE?</head><p>Aside from hungry monsters, a bandit gang has made its home here, as have bugbears and goblins in league with the beholder crime lord known as Xanathar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE UNDERTAKERS</head><p>A gang of neutral evil human bandits calling themselves the Undertakers prey on gullible adventurers, demanding a toll of 10 gp per character for safe passage through this level of the dungeon. The bandits have taken over areas 6 through 8 and have spies watching area 1 to report on intruders.</p><p>The bandits are failed actors and singers who use disguise kits to appear as vampires. These disguises are elaborate and convincing (including wigs, theatrical clothing, makeup, fake fangs, and fake nails), but adventurers can see through the ruse with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.</p><p>The leaders of the gang, Uktarl Krannoc and Harria Valashtar, were lovers once, but their relationship soured recently. They're fed up with each other, and each is plotting to eliminate the other and take control of the gang. Barria is the likely winner of this conflict, because she recently acquired a flesh golem that wandered up from level 2. Struck by Harria's resemblance to its creator, the golem has been pressed into service.</p><p>The Undertakers are aware that bugbears and goblins are spying on them (see "Xanathar Guild" below). If they encounter adventurers whom they can't extort or defeat, the bandits try to orchestrate a conflict between the adventurers and the goblinoids, which they hope will get rid of one or both groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XANATHAR GU ILD</head><p>Nine bugbears (five of them under the control of intellect devourers) represent the Xanathar Guild on this level. They're charged with keeping adventurers from reaching the lower levels and thereby interfering with guild business. With the help of several goblins, the bugbears have set up guild watch posts in areas 23, 28, and 39.</p><p>The bugbears and their goblin toadies are plotting to kidnap one of the leaders of the Undertakers and take that person back to Skullport to have an intellect devourer implanted in their skull, so that Xanathar can take control of the bandit gang. The bugbears have been spying on the bandits and will shortly begin testing their defenses. They are frightened by the flesh golem, though, and will offer to grant safe passage to any adventurers who promise to dispose of it. The bugbears don't keep their end of the bargain, but the goblins readily will do so out of self-preservation if all the bugbears and intellect devourers are dead.</p><p>Three carrion crawlers, one creeping along the floor and two attached to the ceiling, approach the party and attack the first adventurers to come within reach of their mucus-coated tentacles. If a carrion crawler paralyzes a character with its tentacles, it continues to make bite attacks against that character on subsequent rounds as it feeds. The carrion crawlers are too stupid and hungry to flee in the face of certain death.</p><p>GOBLIN SKULL-HUNTERS Pibble and Groin, two argumentative goblins with no affiliations of note, are scouring the dungeon for intact skulls to claim as trophies. Their constant bickering can be heard up to 60 feet away, and they flee when confronted by adventurers. If one or both goblins are captured, they can lead adventurers to the nearest Xanathar Guild watch post as well as describe its defenses, since they have observed the comings and goings of the guild's goblinoids for some time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SHIELD GUARDIAN</head><p>The Dungeon Level is home to a meandering, defective shield guardian operating under the delusion that it's a wizard's apprentice, even to the extent of pretending to cast spells. The guardian returned to this level after its wizard master perished while exploring level 4; the shield guardian's amulet can be found there (level 4, area 16a). A rune on the shield guardian's head matches a rune inscribed on the back of its amulet.</p><p>When the shield guardian sees the characters, it wastes its actions on feeble gesticulations that suggest it's trying to cast harmful spells at them. It reverts to making normal attacks only if one or more characters enter its reach and make melee attacks against it. If the characters keep their distance and avoid harming the shield guardian, it ends its "attack" after a few rounds and wanders off, looking for other denizens to terrorize.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPLORING THIS L EVEL</head><p>All location descriptions for this level are keyed to map 1. Characters who descend into the dungeon from the Yawning Portal land in area 1 and can proceed from there.</p></div>

Skeleton. A kenku skeleton lies on the floor, one of its thin arms pointing toward a bas-relief of a nalfeshnee demon on the south wall. (Halaster artfully placed the skeleton here to help adventurers find the secret door to area 3.)</p><p>The carvings on the north wall of area 2a depict (from east to west) a balor, a barlgura, a chasme, a dretch, a glabrezu, a goristro, and a hezrou. The carvings on the south wall depict (from west to east) a marilith, a nalfeshnee, a quasit, a shadow demon, a vrock, and a yochlol. The recessed wall that contains the nalfeshnee carving has a secret door leading to area 3. The recessed wall that contains the dretch carving has another secret door, which leads to area 4. The dretch carving has half-inch spy-holes for eyes. These holes are detected when the secret door is found. The bugbears detect the approach of adventurers with the aid of the intellect devourers' Detect Sentience trait and therefore can't be surprised. As intruders approach their location, the bugbears withdraw down the southern tunnel and circle around to warn the goblinoids in area 23 of intruders. The bugbears know the perils of the western tunnel (area 21) and avoid it. Characters whose passive Wisdom (Perception) scores equal or exceed the bugbears' Dexterity (Stealth) checks notice the hiding or fleeing bugbears.</p><p>When a bugbear drops to 0 hit points, the intellect devourer in its skull teleports out to seek a new host.</p><p>Secret Compartment.

The tunnel descends slightly until it reaches a room that smells like a sewer. The room contains the following features:</p><p>Flood. The floor of the room tilts-its west end is 6 feet lower than its east end. Foul sewer water covers the floor, barely reaching the east wall but deepening by 1 foot for every 10 feet of travel westward. Statue. A wide alcove in the north wall contains a life. size statue of a sahuagin, submerged up to its chest in sewer water. The statue emits a dim purple radiance, its head is completely turned around, and one of its arms has broken off and is nowhere to be seen. Ooze. A psychic gray ooze lurks beneath the murky water, north of the statue. (It's invisible while underwater.)</p><p>The ooze uses its Psychic Crush action option (see the "Variant: Psychic Gray Ooze" sidebar in the "Oozes" entry in the Monster Manual) to attack anyone who approaches the statue.</p></div>

An unadorned wooden armor stand rests in the middle of the room, with a faintly glowing longsword stabbed into it. At the base of the stand lie the skeletal remains of a hand, amid stains of dried blood. Distant Voices. Echoes of distant voices occasionally fill the room, emanating from 10-inch-long, 5-inch wide vents in the ceiling (see "Echoes" below). Secret Door. A secret door leading south is obvious from this side (no ability check required). It has two eye-holes bored into it at a height of 5 feet, allowing a creature to peer into area 2a beyond.</p><p>The longsword is easy to remove from the armor stand, requiring no ability check. A detect magic spell reveals that the sword is magical. It sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. It also carries a curse that prevents its wielder from dropping it. If the blade is pried from its wielder's grasp, it instantly teleports back into the wielder's hand.

Its velvet seat cushion serves as the hinged lid of an empty hidden compartment. Whatever treasure the compartment once held was stolen by adventurers long ago.</p><p>The throne's serpent armrests magically animate and bite anyone who sits on the throne or raises the seat's lid. Each snake makes a single melee weapon attack (+8 to hit) and deals 3 (ld4 + 1) piercing damage on a hit. Any creature bitten by a snake must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="28.">GRICK SNACK WATCH P OST</head><p>The Xanathar Guild maintains a watch post here, called "Grick Snack" by the bugbears that command it. Two bugbears and six goblins are stationed in this area. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>28B. OBELISK OF THE EYE</head><p>Obelisk. In the north end of this room stands a 14-foottall granite obelisk with a lidless eye carved near its top on the south-facing side. The bottom half of the obelisk is covered with dirty, bloody handprints. Alcoves. Wide alcoves surround the obelisk to the west, north, and east. They contain a dozen goblin beds made of bundled rugs and torn fabric. (The beds have nothing of value.)</p><p>A detect magic spell reveals a faint aura of divination magic surrounding the obelisk, and the goblinoids believe (incorrectly) that Xanathar can see through the obelisk's eye to keep watch on them.</p><p>The first character to touch the obelisk with a bare hand receives the following telepathic message in Common: "I cast my eye into the future and see in yours a perilous descent. South of here, beyond a secret passage, waits the Two-Headed King. Look to his left. There you will see the path you are destined to take." These words seem to emanate from within the obelisk and are meant to sound soothing, but a character who hears the words can discern a hint of subdued madness in them with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check. (The obelisk was created by Halaster and sounds just like him.) The obelisk's "vision" refers to the secret passage at area 38, the two-headed statue in area 39a, and the stairs west of the statue that lead down to level 2.</p><p>Casting dispel magic on the obelisk renders it nonfunctional. Toppling the obelisk requires a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check and causes it to break into myriad pieces on the floor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>28C. EAST CHAMBER</head><p>Goblins. Unless they are led elsewhere, six goblins cower behind broken halves of a stone table tipped on its side. (They peer around the table' s edges with their bows aimed at the rough-hewn tunnel leading east.) Corpses. Lying on the floor between the goblins and the tunnel are two dead goblins (one headless) and a dead grick, riddled with goblin arrows. Secret Door. A secret door in the north wall opens into a tunnel leading north and east. The watch post defenders are unaware of it.</p><p>The goblins have orders to kill any gricks that emerge from the eastern tunnel. Having lost several of their companions to the gricks in area 36, the goblins are jittery and afraid for their lives.</p></div>

Sixteen old shields bearing emblems from long-forgotten human, dwarven, and elven realms hang on the north and south walls of this tunnel. Scrying Eye. As the characters traverse the corridor, a large floating eye surrounded by glowing motes of light appears ahead of them. This is one of Halaster's scrying eyes (see "Halaster's Lair," page 311). It studies the characters for a minute or two before disappearing without a sound.</p></div>

Its howls can be heard throughout the area. Assume it's in area 30b when the characters first arrive. The elemental can tell when someone opens the door at either end of the zigzagging hall or the secret door in the guard room. As soon as it hears a door open or feels a slight change in air pressure, it rushes toward the open doorway, attacking all creatures in its path.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="35.">HALL OF RATS</head><p>The door to this room hangs slightly ajar, and the sound of squeaking rats emanates from within. The room has these features: Gia nt Rats . Ten giant rats scour the room for food.</p><p>Wererat. An obese giant rat is sleeping on the seat of a crumbling stone throne that stands on a dais opposite the door. (This creature is a shapechanged wererat named Flyndol Greeth.) Fountains. Not visible from the door are two semicircular fountains built into the south wall, one in each half of the room (see "Fountains" below).</p><p>Flyndol Greeth is a lazy wererat who serves Xanathar out of fear, not loyalty.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FOUNTAINS</head><p>Each fountain consists of a blue marble basin enclosed by a 1-foot-high stone retaining wall with drainage holes on the inside of the rim to prevent overflow. Carved above each basin is a bas-relief of a dwarf's face with an open mouth. Water from an underground river once flowed out of the mouths and into the basins, but no longer. Both basins are dry, and the dwarves' stone beards are stained and discolored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="36.">LOST HALLS</head><p>These halls are connected by 5-foot-wide, tube-like passages of rough-hewn stone that slope up and down. Dust hangs in the air here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>36A. CRICKS!</head><p>Gricks. Two gricks in the middle of this partially collapsed hall attack all who enter. Debris.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>36B. TRAPPED FELLOW</head><p>Gricks. Five gricks lurk in the diagonal hallway to the south. They attack all who enter. Trapped Advent urer. The sound of weeping comes from behind a closed door in the west wall (leading to a 10-foot-square closet). A small hole has been drilled through the middle of the door.</p><p>An adventuring party called the Fine Fellows of Daggerford descended into Undermountain one tenday ago. One of its members, a thief named Kelim the Weasel (NE human spy), wandered off, snuck into this corner of the dungeon, found a spellbook left behind by a longdead adventurer, and inadvertently aroused the gricks. With his escape route cut off, Kelim sealed himself in the closet to avoid being eaten. He drilled a small hole in the door so that he could peer out of it and get some fresher air. He wants to sneak out while the gricks are asleep or distracted, but he's too scared to leave. He has been without food or water for two days.</p><p>If rescued, Kelim gives his saviors a stolen spellbook as a token of gratitude. Beyond that, he's an unreliable coward who will betray anyone to save his own skin. He doesn't know where the rest of his adventuring party is (see level 2) and doesn't seem to care. The top half of the room is under the effect of a permanent reverse gravity spell. The effect takes hold of any creature or object more than 10 feet off the floor. A successful dispel magic (DC 18) ends the effect, causing creatures and objects on the ceiling to fall if there's nothing to counteract the effect of normal gravity on them.</p><p>Treasure. The mummy is inanimate, and its greataxe is nothing special. One of the gemstones in the mummy's eyes is a banded agate (10 gp), the other a zircon <ref type="bibr">(SO gp)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="37.">MAP ROOM</head><p>Four members of an adventuring party called the Fine Fellows of Daggerford rested here several days ago. An argument between them turned violent, leading three members to kill and dis pose of the fourth. The room has the following features:</p><p>Map. A 30-foot-wide, floor-to-ceiling map is carved into the west wall (see "Fresco" below). Open Pit. In the middle of the room is a 10-foot-square open pit. A r evenant is trapped in the pit and can be heard moving around inside it. Secret Door. A secret door is hidden in the south wall.</p><p>It opens into a curved tunnel (area 38).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MAP CARVING</head><p>This elaborate image is a cross-section map of Undermountain, with what is clearly Mount Waterdeep and the City of Splendors at the top, and twenty-three hollowed-out dungeon levels stacked below it. Each dungeon level has its own stylistic side view, but no names or details are included to suggest what a level is called or what it contains. Three features stand out:</p><p>• Next to the third level is a bas-relief of a flaming skull.</p><p>• Next to the sixteenth level is a bas-relief of a comet.</p><p>• Next to the twenty-third (lowest) level is a bas-relief of a tower with a tiny rune engraved above it.</p><p>Close ins pection reveals that the flaming skull, the comet, and the tower are buttons that can be pressed.</p><p>Flaming Skull. This carving represents Skullport. Each time this button is pressed, a magical, disembodied male voice fills the room and says in Common, "Gate access to S kullport disabled."  <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Each time this button is pressed, a magical, disembodied male voice fills the room and says in Common,  "Gate access to Stardock from level 16 only."  Tower. This carving represents Halaster's extradimensional tower, and the tiny glyph above it is Halaster's  rune. If this button is pressed, a magical, disembodied  male voice fills the room and says in Common, "Gate  access to Halaster's Tower from level 23 only."</ref> PIT The open pit used to be 30 feet deep, but now the bottom 10 feet of the hole are filled with stone rubble. Its sides are smooth and can't be ascended or descended without magic or climbing gear.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REVEN ANT</head><p>When a half-elf cleric of Waukeen named Halleth Garke accused his adventuring companions of withholding treasure from him, the other members of the Fine Fellows of Daggerford (not including Kelim in area 36b, who had already wande red off) beat Halleth to death and threw his body into the pit. Halleth "awoke" the next day as a revenant, compelled to find and kill the three who murdered him. Unfortunately for him, he is unable to climb out of the pit without assistance and has been pacing down there for days.</p><p>If the characters pull him up, Halleth points to the secret door in the south wall and offers to join the party until he locates his "friends," a shield dwarf named Copper Stormforge and two humans named Midna Tauberth and Rex the Hammer. Halleth no longer has access to his cleric spells, and his companions stole his gear (including his holy symbol), along with a wholly incorrect map of the Sargauth Level (level 3). He is willing to let the characters keep the map once they help him confront his killers and retrieve it. He believes the map is authentic and accurate. When the three Fine Fellows die, Halleth becomes a corpse again; if the characters helped him, award them XP as though they had defeated the revenant in combat. See level 2 for more information on Halleth's killers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>39A. HALL OF THE "TWO-HEADED KING</head><p>Characters will most likely enter this hall through the secret door in the west wall. This 30-foot-high room has the following features:</p><p>Statue. A deformed granite statue stands on the east side of a large stone column, facing eastward.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_45">The statue is life-size and depicts a dwarf king  standing atop a 3-foot-high stone pedestal. Sprouting  from the king's neck is a deformed, mostly featureless  second head with</ref>  Treasure. The gold circlet is a circlet of blasting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>39B. BUGBEAR DEN</head><p>Three bugbears sit in the middle of the floor, eating from a sack of dead rats and stirges. One of them has an intellect devourer in its skull, which is controlling it like a puppeteer. Because of the intellect devourer's Detect Sentience trait, the bugbears can't be surprised by the adventurers. When the intellect devourer's host drops to 0 hit points, the intellect devourer teleports away to seek a new host.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>39c. GOBLIN HALL</head><p>Goblins. Nineteen loud, mean, starving goblins bicker and fight over scraps of moldy food in this long hall. Dead Goblin. A twentieth goblin lies dead on the floor, the victim of an argument that ended badly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>39D. O LD FORGE</head><p>Ettins. Two ettins, a female named Krung-Jung and a male named Bokk-Nokkin, live in this foul-smelling room. Branded on each of their foreheads is the symbol of Xanathar: a circle with ten equidistant spokes radiating outward from it and a dot in the center. Forge. A blackened forge dominates the north wall. The magic that once heated the forge expired long ago. The ettins keep their treasure inside it (see "Treasure" below). An iron anvil stands atop a 3-foot-high circular stone dais in front of the hearth. Hammer. Hanging above the anvil from thick iron chains is a 7,000-pound stone hammer, 10 feet long and 8 feet wide. Carved into one side of its stone head are the Dwarvish runes for earth and water; the other side is carved with similar runes for air and fire. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="40.">FEA RFUL MIMICRY</head><p>Statues. This T-shaped hall has three alcoves, two to the north and one to the south. In each alcove is a beautifully carved granite statue depicting an 8-foottall, helmed elf warrior hefting a spear. Mimic. Stone rubble is piled up behind the statue in the southernmost alcove. The spear held by this statue appears to be made of gold. (Both this statue and its spear are a m imic. The creature uses its fake gold spear as a lure.)</p><p>The mimic is a Large specimen with 75 (lOdlO + 20) hit points.

A 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long, 45-foot-deep crack has opened in the middle of the 30-foot-high ceiling, spilling rubble onto the floor. Twenty stirges roost at the top of this fissure. Tools. Old pickaxes and shovels are stored in two stone wheelbarrows parked in the northwest corner.</p><p>The stirges hang like bats in the ceiling fissure and descend en masse to feed on creatures that make too much noise or shine light up at them. Bugbears come here occasionally to catch and kill stirges for food.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AFTERMATH</head><p>Defeating the Undertakers means that future parties of adventurers can explore this level of the dungeon without paying tolls for safe passage. The gang's removal, however, also allows bugbears, goblins, wererats, and other Xanathar Guild operatives to set up new watch posts in the bandits' former hideouts.</p><p>Destroying the Xanathar Guild outposts makes this level a much safer place for a while, but it a lso spells the end of the force that kept the grells, the gricks, and other predatory monsters in check. Such creatures begin to expand their territory, occasionally bumping up against one another with predictably bloody results.</p><p>One thing that never changes is the steady influx of new blood from the Yawning Portal. At any time, another group of adventurers might descend to seek their fortune in Undermountain. Such a group, perhaps encountered as the characters make their way back to Waterdeep, could greet the characters as friendly rivals or as competition that must be eliminated.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WHAT DWELLS HERE?</head><p>A tribe of goblins has claimed many rooms on this level and erected a bazaar. These goblins oppose the Xanathar Guild and its beholder overlord. The rest of the dungeon is infested with sentient magical experiments and leftovers from the days when Halaster's apprentices used this level as a laboratory. The characters might also encounter a troublesome drow, a wererat gang, and members of a doomed adventuring party.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GOBLINS</head><p>The Rustbone tribe of goblins has claimed an old throne room (area 1) and turned it into a bazaar. The Xanathar Guild wants to s hut down the market before it attracts too many surface dwellers, while the goblins fight to keep it open. Admission into the goblin bazaar is free, but non-goblinoids are closely watched.</p><p>The goblin boss, Yek, recently found a magic circlet that transformed him into a human (see area lf). After his initial surprise passed, Yek warmed to the transformation. After all, it made him taller. The other goblins quietly resent taking orders from a human and would like to see Yek returned to normal. They might conspire with adventurers toward that end, offering them the circlet as a reward for undoing Yek's "curse."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XANATHAR GUILD</head><p>The Xanathar Guild aims to secure this level, plunder it thoroughly, and return valuable items to Skullport to be sold, thus boosting the town's sagging economy. There are two Xanathar Guild watch posts on the level, and each one has a leader: a drow named Shunn "Spider Eyes" Shurreth commands the northern watch post at area 9, and a human berserker named Nadia the Unbent leads the southern watch post at area 20.</p><p>Wererats recently stole a stone key from the southern outpost. Shunn believes that the key unlocks something important (though he doesn't know what that might be) and wants to reclaim it. He intends to capture a wererat and ransom it for the safe return of the key. He offers SO gp to anyone who brings him a wererat captive or the location of the wererats' hideout (area 14).</p></div>

The drow, Rizzeryl, has eight wererats in his employ. The Xanathar Guild is aware of the wererats, but not their drow master.</p><p>Rizzeryl has the stone key that the wererats stole from the Xanathar Guild. He thinks it might unlock a Melairkyn vault hidden somewhere on this level, but he's wrong. In fact, the key opens a magic gate that connects levels 6 and 8 of Undermountain. The drow will give up this key in exchange for his life or the destruction of the Xanathar Guild outposts on this level.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_45">Halleth the revenant (see level !, area  37) accompanies the characters, he uses his Vengeful  Tracker trait to lead the party to his former companions  so he can repay them for their betrayal. These three  "Fine Fellows" are:</ref> • Copper Stormforge, a dwarven thief, values gold above all. He has been captured by goblins and imprisoned in area le. • Midna Tauberth, a human priest of Shar, thinks she can do everything herself. The perils of this level have forced her to take refuge in area llb. • Rex the Hammer, a human warrior, seeks fortune and glory, and doesn't care whom he steps on to achieve it.

The middle of the chamber is taken up by eight vendor stalls. Twenty-two goblins are here, sixteen vendors (two per stall) and six guards who stand in pairs near the exits to areas l e, lf, and 8. Throne. A granite throne stands against the north wall atop a rectangular stone dais.</p><p>The goblin vendors buy and sell stolen goods, including items listed in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbookparticularly armor, shields, weapons, adventuring gear, tools, trade goods, food, and drink. The goblins buy goods at half the normal price and sell them at three times the normal price. Their food is of poor quality but edible. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check can bargain a goblin down to half its asking price for an item.</p><p>The goblin guards have orders to keep the peace. If a brawl or a battle erupts, they attack with the goal of knocking troublesome visitors unconscious.

Each goblin vendor carries a fat pouch with 3d6 gp, 3d8 sp, and 3d10 cp in it. The bugbears work for Yek because he pays them. A bugbear abandons Yek and returns home to Skullport (on level 3) if given a bribe of 5 gp or more.</p><p>lfYek orders the goblins into battle, they fight reluctantly. If half are killed or incapacitated, the rest flee. The goblins also run away ifYek is slain.</p><p>Yek wears a gold circlet (see "Treasure" below) that has transformed him into a beautiful adult male human. In this form , his size is Medium. If the characters humble themselves before Yek and appeal to his vanity, they are treated fairly. If they attempt to steal from him or have harmed any of his underlings, Yek sentences them to death and orders his goblin toadies and the bugbears to attack. Yekjoins the fray only in self-defense.</p><p>If the characters and Yek part company on peaceful terms, three ofYek's goblin toadies try to speak to the characters afterward, away from the goblin boss. They plead with the characters to end Yek's "curse" by stealing the circlet that has transformed the goblin boss into a human. They don't have a plan for doing so and are hoping the characters can devise one. The toadies can get all the other goblins out of the hall, but they have no control over Yek's bugbear bodyguards.</p><p>Shaved Dwarf. The beardless dwarf is Copper Stormforge, a member of the Fine Fellows of Dagger ford adventuring party. His hatred for goblins increased tenfold when they chopped off his beard, and if he is set free, he tries to kill every one of them. As a reward for setting him free, Copper gives his liberators what he claims is an authentic map of the Sargauth Level (level 3). Copper folded the map into a tiny package and tucked it between his butt cheeks to hide it from his captors. He doesn't realize the map is fake and utterly worthless.</p><p>Copper is a shield dwarf scout, with these changes:</p><p>• Copper is neutral evil.</p><p>• He has these racial traits: He speaks Common and Dwarvish. His walking speed is 25 feet. He has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, advantage on saving throws against poison, and resistance to poison damage. He has no weapons.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_75">The circlet chooses the physical characteristics of the  form , such as age, gender, skin color, hair color, and  voice.

YEK'S TREASURE This room contains the following treasure:</p><p>• A gruesome diorama featuring the stuffed corpses of a beholder and six goblins, all of them in battle poses and adorned with costume jewelry • An ivory chessboard on a low stone table A 9-foot-tall, 3-foot-wide framed painting ofYek, depicting him in his regal human form, standing proudly with his golden circlet on his brow • A hefty, iron-banded wooden chest with iron rings for handles</p><p>Characters who loot the diorama find fifteen pieces of costume jewelry worth 1 gp each. The ivory chessboard is worth 25 gp. The wooden chest is filled with 2,000 sp.</p><p>The painting ofYek has no real value, though a clever character can sell it for 50 gp by convincing a naive buyer that the painting depicts a figure of historical importance; doing so requires a successful DC 13 Charisma (Deception) check.</p></div>

WIZARD'S KITCHEN</head><p>This decrepit kitchen contains an oven range, a washing basin, a hearth bearing a covered cook pot, and shelves filled with pots, pans, and cooking tools.</p><p>A specter hides in the covered cook pot, emerging if the lid is lifted or if the specter is disturbed by noises from area 2b. The specter can command four nearby pots and pans to do its bidding; treat these objects as flying swords that deal bludgeoning damage instead of slashing damage. If the specter is defeated, the pots and pans clatter to the ground, becoming inanimate once more. The summoning circle hidden under the rug radiates an aura of abjuration magic under the scrutiny of a detect magic spell, but three of its activation glyphs have been erased. A character who examines the circle and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana or Investigation) check can reconstruct the circle and, with blood or paint, reapply the missing glyphs in ldlO minutes.</p><p>If the circle is completed, it immediately summons Kalabash (CE male Calishite human m age). Appearing in the middle of the circle, Kalabash attacks any creatures he sees. He is intoxicated and suffers the effects of the poisoned condition until he sobers up or until the condition is ended with a lesser restoration spell or similar magic. Erasing part of the completed circle causes Kalabash to be whisked back to his pocket dimension.</p><p>The only item of value Kalabash has is his spellbook, which contains all the spells he has prepared. He also carries around an empty wine flask.</p><p>Trapped Chest. The wooden chest is of solid construction, and its steel lock is warded with a magic trap. Picking the Jock requires thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. If that check does not succeed, or if anyone tries to break or smash the lock, the mechanism releases a small bolt of lightning that deals 10 (3d6) lightning damage to the creature tampering with it (no saving throw). The chest is empty except for a note in Common that reads, "Retirement fund . Don't spend this on ale, Kalabash!"</p><p>Treasure. The desk has twenty old books on it.

A successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check forces open either door. Apart from these crude barricades, the room contains the following:</p><p>Automaton. An animated, life-size puppet of Ha laster Blackcloak is hard at work on an experiment. The puppet is made primarily of wood and canvas, with a shoddy gray cloak draped over its shoulders. Dozens of cloth eyes have been sewn into the cloak. <ref type="table" target="#tab_75">Table.

ABANDONED CAMP</head><p>The Xanathar Guild had a base camp here, but it was forced to abandon the place after a run-in with the Fine Fellows of Dagger ford.</p><p>This room is strewn with rotten supplies and the remains of a fire pit. Three bugbear corpses and an intellect devourer's body are heaped in the northeast corner. Searching the corpses reveals a scrap of parchment with the following phrase written on it in Common: "As many as there are stars in the sky." This is the pass phrase to safely enter the Xanathar Guild outpost at area 9.</p></div>

The arch's keystone has a tiny slot in it. This is one of Halaster's magic gates (see "Gates," page 12), and its rules are as follows:</p><p>• Feeding a gold coin into the slot in the keystone causes the coin to disappear and the gate to open for 1 minute. Other coins placed in the slot disappear but don't open the gate. Characters must be 8th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The fi rst creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12). • A creature that passes through the gate appears in area l lc on level 4, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">MUSIC OF THE DEAD</head><p>The hallway leading to this chamber is filled with the haunting sound of a harpsichord playing. The room contains the following:</p><p>Harpsichord <ref type="table" target="#tab_75">. In the middle of the room is a harpsichord made entirely of bones, with human, dwarf,  ogre, and halfling finger bones for keys. Somber music emanates from it.  Carving. Carved into the north wall is a single measure</ref> of musical notes. They are faded and difficult to read.</p><p>The bone harpsichord has been enchanted to play on its own but stops when a living creature comes within 10 feet of it. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around the harpsichord and a smaller aura of necromancy magic emanating from something inside it.</p><p>Any character who has proficiency with a musical instrument can correctly play the displayed notes on the bone harpsichord. Any other character who tries to do so must make a DC 20 Intelligence (Performance) check. A successful check causes a decorative skull above the keys to fall away, revealing the treasure (see "Treasure" below). On a failed check, the performer must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the performer takes 22 (4d10) necrotic damage, and the flesh of its hands is eaten away, leaving bleached white (but functional) skeletal hands.</p><p>Treasure. Hidden inside the harpsichord is a spell scroll of raise dead. Correctly playing the musical notes opens a hidden compartment that contains the scroll.</p><p>Smashing or breaking open the harpsichord damages the scroll, rendering it useless.</p></div>

Odd metal instruments designed for measuring electricity rest atop tables, along with several loose scraps of parchment with notes that include terms such as "rate of decay" and "accumulation of charge." Log Entry. A thorough search of the room yields a scrap of paper that was once part of Trenzia's log. It reads, "Day 1: Halaster has granted me this abandoned copper mine in the Arcane Chambers. Finally, I have access to the components needed for my experiments." Everything beyond that point is smudged and illegible.</p></div>

A flesh golem stands in the middle of the room amid destroyed tables, shards of broken glass, and rusty mining equipment. Chute. A 5-foot-wide, 5-foot-high chute in the southeast corner curves downward, descending 20 feet to area 13a. (The chute contains plenty of handholds and footholds. No ability check is required to descend it.)</p><p>Trenzia. After she was driven mad by her scientific and necromantic experiments, Trenzia convinced Halaster to transform her into a ftameskull, with these changes:</p><p>• The skull has resistance to fire damage and immunity to lightning damage. • It has the lightning bolt spell prepared instead of fireball.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>• Replace its Fire Ray attack option with a Lightning</head><p>Ray attack option that deals lightning damage instead of fire damage.</p><p>On each of its turns, the skull uses its action to electrify the copper-plated floor with its lightning rays. The floor remains electrified until the start of the skull's next turn. While the floor is electrified, any creature that steps onto the copper tiles or starts its turn in contact with them takes 10 (3d6) lightning damage. Instead of taking damage, the flesh golem regains 10 hit points whenever it starts its turn on the electrified floor.</p><p>If the skull is destroyed and later rejuvenates (see the flameskull's Rejuvenation trait), it resumes electrifying the floor and defending the room, with or without the golem.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_75">the golem attacks Trenzia's skull in its berserk frenzy,  the skull uses its next action to try to calm the golem.

Pickaxes and hammers litter the floor, as do the gnawed bones, torn black robes, and rubber boots of a female half-elf wizard. Notably absent is the half-elf's skull.

The curse partially transformed him into a spider, giving him eight red arachnid eyes, a mouth full of fangs, and black bristles sprouting from his slender limbs. A remove curse or greater restoration spell restores Shunn's natural form, but Shunn doesn't want the curse lifted. His horrific appearance strikes fear into the hearts of his comrades-in-arms and has earned him favor with Xanathar. Shunn believes that returning to his normal form might weaken his influence over his gang and diminish his status in the Xanathar Guild.</p><p>Shunn is a drow elite warrior, with these changes:</p><p>• Shunn is lawful evil.</p><p>• While cursed with spider features, he can climb difficult surfaces, even across ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</p><p>Shunn moves and converses with an eerie grace and prefers diplomacy over violence when dealing with adventurers.

Against the south wall stands a long banquet table bearing fresh foodstuffs on copper platters and copper flagons filled to the brim with wine. A portrait of a smiling Halaster hangs above the table.</p><p>Each day at dawn, the platters and flagons on the table are mystically replenished with fresh food and wine, courtesy of Ha laster's magic. The effect produces enough food and wine for twelve people. The magic persists as long as the table remains in this room and there is dishware capable of containing the bounty.</p><p>Midna Tauberth. Midna isn't interested in sharing her newfound lair with others. She advises characters to leave or face the wrath of her invisible servants. If they don't leave at once, she orders the servants to beat them senseless.

At least for now, Rizzeryl and the wererats are staunch allies.</p><p>Rizzeryl works for two groups: House Auvryndar, a low-ranking drow house from Menzoberranzan that is slowly and secretly consolidating its power in Undermountain, and the Zhentarim, which is trying to drive the Xanathar Guild out of Skullport. His ties to the Black Network make Rizzeryl an enemy of the Xanathar Guild, which currently controls Skullport and is trying to secure the uppermost levels of Undermountain.</p><p>Rizzeryl has begun haranguing the Xanathar Guild forces on this level with the help of the wererat gang, which hails from Skullport. The drow wizard and the wererats have no quarrel with adventurers who leave them alone.</p></div>

Rizzeryl the drow mage and his wererat gang can pass through the door, while other creatures must force it open with magic or a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check.</p><p>The room contains the following:</p><p>Dr ow. Rizzeryl the drow mage sits on a chair in the southwest corner while resting in a trance. If he hears someone coming through the eastern door, he casts greater invisibility on himself. <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table. A wooden table in the center of the room bears a  map made of loose stones arranged to form walls and  doors (see "Tabletop Map" below).   Rizzeryl likes to be invisible as he engages intruders  in conversation, hoping to learn their intentions. Any  noise here alerts the wererats in area 14b, who remain  hidden until Rizzeryl calls for them.  Rizzeryl offers the adventurers a reward if they destroy both Xanathar Guild outposts on this level (areas 9  and 20) and return with the heads of both guild leaders,  whose names, he tells them, are Nadia the Unbent and  S hunn Shurreth.

Beneath Rizzeryl's chair is  a loose floor tile that conceals a hidden compartment,  which can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom  (Perception) check. It contains three items: Rizzeryl's  leather-bound spellbook (which holds the spells he has  prepared, plus arcane lock and sending), a 12-inch-long  stone key, a 12-inch-long driftwood wand with the symbol of Xanathar (a circle with ten equidistant spokes  radiating outward from its circumference) carved at one  end. Rizzeryl uses this nonmagical wand to slip past  the guardian in area 20a and to move through Skullport  unmolested.  The stone key weighs 10 pounds and bears the following inscription in Dwarvish: "Meet me on the Lost  Level. Find my twin in S litherswamp." A detect magic  s pell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around the  key, which opens a magic gate that connects levels 6  and 8 ofUndermountain (see level 6, area 34b, and level  8 , area 3, for more information on each gate).

The doors are painted with images of two dwarves in profile, facing each other while standing on s ideways barrels.</p><p>The Melairkyn dwarves s tored ale in these vats. Each vat is a hollow, slightly bulging stone cylinder 10 feet high and 10 feet in diameter, with 6-inch-thick walls. A copper spigot is embedded in the vats on the side facing the nearest wall, at a height of 3 feet. A narrow stone staircase curls up the exterior of each vat to the top, which is fitted with a hinged copper lid. The vats' interiors are lined with copper and have a pipe at the bottom that runs under the floor to the a le dispenser in area 22a. Barrels <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">. There are thirty empty barrels, all made of   iron-banded zurkhwood (a woody fungus). Most are in  such poor condition that they can no longer hold liquids  without leaking, but clever characters can use them to  safely avoid the pit traps in area 22d.</ref> 22D. BARREL RUN Beyond a 10-foot landing, this hall gradually slopes down toward the west. Secret doors at the west end of the hall open into areas 22e and 22f, respectively. Dwarves used to fill barrels of ale and roll them down this hall to be stored in the secret chambers.</p><p>Pit Traps. The Melairkyn dwarves built three 20-footdeep pits in the sloped floor to guard their ale supplies. The pits' covers blend in with the surrounding floor, though a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check detects each pit. When a creature weighing 50 pounds or more steps on a pit's cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the creature to spill into the pit below and take 2d6 bludgeoning damage from the fall. The lid is spring-loaded and snaps closed after the creature falls through. A successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the lid open. A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see in the dark.</p><p>Wedging at least two iron spikes between the pit's lid and the surrounding floor prevents the lid from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The lid can also be magically held shut with an arcane lock spell or similar magic. The dwarves constructed the pit covers so that they won't open if an object is rolled over them. A character can circumvent the traps by climbing into an empty barrel and rolling down the hall or climbing onto a barrel and balancing atop it as it rolls down the hall. Balancing atop a barrel as it careens down the hall requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.</p></div>

Stacked in the middle of the room are one hundred forty zurkhwood barrels banded in iron. The barrels form a 21-foothigh pyramid with a base measuring seven barrels on a side. Engraved on the lid of each barrel is a magical glyph that radiates an aura of abjuration magic under the scrutiny of a detect magic spell.</p><p>Treasure. Each barrel contains 40 gallons of dwarven ale that has been magically preserved for centuries. Removing a barrel's lid or breaking the barrel causes its glyph to fade away, ending the preservation spell on that barrel. If the ale is marketed as "Melairkyn Ale," "Undermountain Ale," or something similar, characters can sell a barrel of it for 40 gp in Waterdeep. A full barrel of ale weighs approximately 400 pounds.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_75">Fifty-nine of them remain intact, their ale  preserved.

Halaster found this rogue modron, decided to adopt it, and gave it a name: Halastron. The modron considers Halaster its friend and follows his orders to the best of its ability.

Walk in a counterclockwise circle around the  caryatids when not defending itself or the pillars .</ref> The quadrone speaks and understands the Modron language only. It knows that the caryatids can restore petrified creatures to flesh, having seen them in action, and it has heard Halaster speak the command phrase to activate the caryatids. Its instructions don't prevent it from communicating with strangers or sharing information with them. It knows almost nothing about Undermountain and disintegrates if reduced to 0 hit points.</p></div>

The pot is painted with images of a bare-footed elf druid leading a march of small, uprooted shrubs that seem to be walking of their own accord. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the pot, which is a common wondrous magic item called a pot of awakening. If one plants an ordinary shrub in the pot and lets it grow for 30 days, the shrub magically transforms into an awakened s hrub at the end of that time.

This level of Undermountain is connected to the subterranean settlement of Skullport by way of tunnels, as well as the River Sargauth itself (see "Skullport," page 303). More ancient than Skullport is the town of Stromkuhldur, whose ruins lie half-buried in the heart of the Sargauth Level. Goblinoids and drow vie for control of these ruins, which were previously inhabited by the Netherese and the Melairkyn dwarves.</p></div>

Since then, many factions have fought over this outpost. Currently the drow of House Auvryndar and the goblinoids of the Legion of Azrok are teetering on the brink of a war that Halaster and the Xanathar Guild both seek to foment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HOUSE AUVRYNDAR</head><p>A drow priestess of Lolth named T'rissa Auvryndar and her retinue have assumed control of a section of Stromkuhldur (area 20) and converted a temple once dedicated to Dumathoin into a hatchery for giant spiders. Under T'rissa's command, the drow have begun secret experiments using humanoids as incubators for giant spider eggs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LEGION OF AZROK</head><p>Azrok, the son of a hobgoblin warlord, was born blind. Such a curse would ordinarily have spelled his doom in hobgoblin society, but Azrok's mother was a sorcerer, and she refused to allow her son's misfortune to dictate his destiny. She crafted a dagger of blindsight, which young Azrok used to defend himself and perceive his surroundings. The dagger allowed Azrok to become the powerful soldier and leader he was fated to be, and he was quickly promoted up through the ranks until none stood above him. Other goblinoids believed he was blessed by Maglubiyet, the great god of war. Azrok wisely hid the true source of his "godsight" to perpetuate the myth.</p><p>Age granted Azrok wisdom and the desire to carve out a domain of his own. He led his forces to Stromkuhldur, and they rid the place of grimlocks and troglodytes that dwelled there. He sired an heir, ensuring that his legacy would last beyond his lifetime. His son, Azrokkog, chafed at his father's sedentary nature and left to wage wars of his own, eventually returning to Undermountain with a new name-Doomcrown-and a new purpose (see "Level 14: Arcturiadoom," page 179).</p><p>The Legion of Azrok, which has lived in Stromkuhldur for three decades, is in turmoil. Azrok was recently forced to give up a portion of his domain to encroaching drow, and did so with nary a fight. This has sent shock waves through his legion. What caused this strange lack of courage in their great warlord? Has age finally taken its toll?</p><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_75">reality, a band of duergar thieves posing as merchants recently stole Azrok's dagger of blindsight and  fled using their invisibility. News of the theft reached  the drow of House Auvryndar and spurred them to take  over the eastern section of Stromkuhldur. Lurkana,  Azrok's wife and strongest captain, tried to cover up her  husband's blindness, but her efforts were undone by a  mind flayer acting as Skullport's ambassador. This mind  fl.ayer secretly implanted intellect devourers in the skulls  of several goblins in Azrok's court, and these goblins  are spreading the truth of Azrok's blindness throughout  Stromkuhldur to further besmirch his reputation and  demoralize his troops.  The hobgoblins under Azrok remain loyal to him, but  many of the goblins and bugbears have fled</ref>  Adventurers who enter western Stromkuhldur (area 21) are brought before Azrok and Lurkana (in area 21 n) as a manner of protocol. After Azrok guarantees their safety in his settlement, Lurkana takes them aside and offers a reward for the safe return of her husband's magic dagger. She emphasizes that without the dagger, the invading drow and the Xanathar Guild might conquer Stromkuhldur and become immensely more powerful. She reminds the adventurers that the Legion of Azrok has never once threatened Waterdeep-but the drow or the guild might leap at the chance to do just that.</p><p>Lurkana knows that the th ieves who stole the dagger are duergar of Clan lroneye, and she thinks they might be hiding in Skullport. (Characters who make discreet inquiries in Skullport can learn that a large contingent of duergar from Clan lroneye resupplied in Skullport and drank ale at a local tavern called the Black Tankard before heading deeper into Undermountain. The tavern's tight-lipped duergar proprietor, Droon Stonedark, denies everything. The characters can catch up to the duergar of Clan lroneye on level 6.)</p><p>If the characters accept her quest, Lurkana suggests they search Skullport first and points them in the right direction (beyond area 23). She also suggests that they speak with Skullport's ambassador to Stromkuhldur (the mind fl ayer in area 21 g) to see if it knows anything. She cautions them not to harm the ambassador in any way, so as not to fray relations any further.</p><p>Reward. In exchange for the dagger, Lurkana is prepared to pay 1,000 gp de livered in a locked chest along with the key. If the characters demand more, she is willing to increase the payment to 1,500 gp and throw in two bugbears and five goblins as bodyguards and scouts. Unknown to Lurkana, two of the goblins have intellect devourers in their skulls and act as secret spies for Xanathar. The bugbears and other goblins serve the adventurers well, but being evil and greedy, they become increasingly difficult to control over time.</p><p>LEVEL <ref type="table" target="#tab_45">3 I SARGAUTH LEVEL   SEA HAGS OF THE SARGAUTH   Eager to expunge the drow occupying his dungeon,  Halaster has summoned a coven of sea hags from the  frigid waters of the River Sargauth.

Slumped against the west wall is the moldy skeleton of a human pirate clutching a rusty shortsword in one hand and a wooden tankard in the other. A shattered wooden cask lies nearby. Careful examination of the wall above the skeleton reveals a slot carved into the stone. The slot has the same width and depth as the pirate's rusty blade. If this shortsword or one like it is inserted into the slot, a loose rock in the ceiling falls away, and with it comes a moldy old chest. The chest splinters when it hits the floor, spilling out its contents: 500 sp, a sharkskin pouch containing five moss agates (10 gp each), a pair of bone dice (1 gp), a 6-inch-tall empty obsidian bottle carved in the shape of a wizard's tower with a removable cork roof (50 gp), a pearl necklace (250 gp), and a shriveled sea elf's head with a potion of water breathing stuffed in its mouth (with the vial's cork sticking out).</p><p>All the caves in this area are cold and damp, with water dripping from the ceiling to form shallow pools of water everywhere.</p></div>

It is home to a coven of three sea hags in league with Halaster Blackcloak. Each hag has a giant crab pet that follows her around and obeys her commands. The cave's other features are as follows:</p><p>Noise. The sound of splashing geysers (see area lOd) echoes throughout. Pools. The uneven floor has many shallow pits filled with dirty water. The hags use these pits as baths and hide in them if they see lights approaching or hear unfamiliar footsteps. Decor. A vast variety of shells are embedded in the slick, algae-coated walls.</p><p>If the characters previously met with Anderian Dusk, the lantern merchant of Skullport, the sea hags are already acquainted with them thanks to the hag eye pendant that Dusk wears. In this case, they address the characters in familiar tones and ask them if they took time to sample some of Skullport's local ales. Otherwise, they politely introduce themselves as Coral Black, Gurgle Brine, and Caldra Cuttlefingers.</p><p>While all three hags are alive, they gain the Shared Spellcasting trait, as described in the "Hag Covens" sidebar in the "Hags" entry in the Monster Manual. The hags aren't spoiling for a fight with non-drow, because Halaster has tasked them solely with ridding the Sargauth Level of the dark elves. The hags keep their affiliation with Halaster a secret and pretend to be harmless shell collectors with no enemies to speak of. They use adventurers to do their dirty work, promising not only safe passage through their caves but also information meant to turn them against the drow. Throughout the conversation, they supply the following observations:</p><p>• "A drow priestess has defiled an ancient dwarven temple on the other side of the river, turning it into a profane breeding pit for spider abominations." • "The drow are kidnapping folk from the city above.</p><p>Those not fed to the spiders are sacrificed to the vile demon goddess worshiped by the drow." • "The drow have already infiltrated Skullport and found its defenses lacking. An invasion is imminent. The capture of Skullport will give the drow a firm base from which to strike into the heart of Undermountain. What's next? Waterdeep?"  <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">In the middle of this 20-foot-high cave,  the floor bulges and forms a 5-foot-diameter  stone cauldron.  Decor. Ship rigging and tattered sails hang from the  ceiling like web strands and torn curtains.</ref> The stone cauldron, created by Halaster, is filled to the brim with murky water and has five rusty iron keys at the bottom. (These keys unlock the shackles in area lOg.) The cauldron has AC 17, 60 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If reduced to 0 hit points, the cauldron cracks and is destroyed. The sea hags use the cauldron as a focus for their scrying spell.</p><p>The first time a creature other than a sea hag disturbs the water or damages the cauldron, an elder rune materializes above it (see "Elder Runes," page 12). Draw from the Elder Runes Deck (see appendix B) to determine which rune appears. The elder rune targets a random creature within 60 feet of it.</p><p>Any creature that drinks a pint or more of water from the cauldron must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour per pint consumed.</p></div>

Old chains bolted to the walls end in five sets of rusty shackles, the keys to which are hidden inside the cauldron in area lOe. A character with thieves' tools can pick each lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.</p><p>Two prisoners are chained here when the characters arrive: an unarmed goblin named Lerk and a 13-yearold boy named Delvin Stormshore (CG male Illuskan human commoner with no weapons).</p><p>The hags caught Delvin after he and a friend "borrowed" a rowboat and used it to explore the sea caves near Skullport. When the sea hags attacked, Delvin's friend leaped out of the boat and managed to swim away, but Delvin wasn't so lucky. He's so cold and scared that he stammers when he tries to talk.</p><p>For its own amusement, the wicked goblin has been tormenting Delvin by threatening to eat him before the hags return. Since the boy can't see in the dark, he mistakes the bullying goblin for his jailer, not another prisoner. If rescued, Delvin insists that the characters call him "Del" and gladly offers to carry their gear for them.</p><p>Like most goblins, Lerk is a cowardly bully. He's very hungry and begs characters for food and freedom.</p></div>

Unless its magic is dispelled, the banshee figurehead lets out a tremendous wail if any creature other than a sea hag approaches within 10 feet of the crow's nest. The banshee's wail echoes throughout the cavern and can be heard as far away as area lOc. If the hags survive, they gather reinforcements from areas lOa and lOb and rush to defend their precious treasure.</p><p>Treasure. The crow's nest contains 2,000 cp inside a lidless wooden chest, 250 sp inside a tin urn, an umbrella, a set of weaver's tools, an ebony walking cane with an octopus-shaped handle made of pewter (25 gp), and a cracked spyglass (250 gp).</p></div>

An inscription carved into the door's molding has also been damaged, rendering it indecipherable. Ferry.

While asleep, the creature remains s tanding, its mouth and eyes closed, its arms hanging limply with knuckles scraping the floor. Stone Cubes. Twenty cubes of solid granite measuring 8 feet on a side are arranged about the chamber. One cube near the west wall, marked with an X on map 3, is fake (see "Fake Cube" below). Statues. Four unfinished statues situated around the room have piles of chipped stone around their bases.</p><p>Until it escaped captivity and hid here, the xorn was one of Halaster's prized pets, raised on a steady diet of magic gemstones to dramatically increase its size. It comes and goes by phasing through the walls, and it enjoys the quiet solitude that this chamber provides. A successful DC 16 Dexterity (Stealth) check allows a creature to cross the room quietly without waking the xorn, but the check is made with disadvantage if the creature is carrying coins or gemstones, since the xorn can detect such treasures by scent even while it is asleep. The discovery of intruders in its lair provokes its anger, causing it to attack.</p><p>The xorn has a challenge rating of 8 <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">(3,900 XP) and  the following changes to its statistics:   • The xorn is Large and has 103 (9d10 + 54) hit points.  • Its Strength is 20 (+5), and its melee weapon attacks  have a +8 bonus to hit. Its claw attacks have a reach  of 10 feet and deal 9 (Id8 + 5) slashing damage on a  hit, and its bite attack deals 22 (5d6 + 5) piercing damage on a hit.</ref> Fake Cube. Although simila r in appearance to the granite blocks, this 8-foot cube is hollow with 3-inchthick plaster sides. A dwarf within 10 feet of the cube can tell at a glance what it's made of, as can a character who taps the cube with a hammer or a similar tool. Any creature weighing more than 50 pounds that stands on the cube fa lls into it as the plaster gives way underfoot.</p><p>The cube contains a chipped a labaster throne of elven design, sturdy in construction yet elegant in form. It is intricately carved to resemble bundled branches and twigs, with a tiny songbird perched on one end of its back. There used to be five carved songbirds perched atop the throne, but four have been broken off and lost.</p><p>The throne was carved by the elves of Illefarn, an ancient kingdom of the North. It disappeared from its capital (located where Waterdeep stands today) shortly before the kingdom's destruction 2,500 years ago. The Melairkyn dwarves found it in damaged condition and planned to return it to the elves as a gift after repairing it. Dwarven adventurers later found it and hid it in hopes of returning when they had a means of getting it out of the dungeon, but they didn't make it back. Finding the throne and informing Volo of its whereabouts completes a quest (see "Throne of the Coronal," page 8).</p><p>As one of the oldest surviving relics of Illefarn, the throne is priceless. It has two minor magical properties:</p><p>• A creature sitting in the throne can't tell a lie.</p><p>• The throne is surprisingly light for its size, weighing only 500 pounds.</p><p>Unfinished S tatues. Represented by the s tatue icons on map 3, these four unfinished samples of dwarven stonecraft, from north to south, are:</p><p>• A mostly finished statue of a female dwarf priest carrying a stone censer • A half-finished statue of a cheery dwarf girl riding on the shoulders of her beaming father, whose lower body has not yet been carved • A half-finished stone door carved with the image of a heavily armored dwarf clashing axes with a minotaur • A mostly uncarved block of stone from which the features of an ornate stone brazier are emerging</p></div>

Webs and Spiders. Webs are strung between the buildings, but they're not thick enough to inhibit movement. Nine giant spiders roam the alleys between the buildings in search of prey.</p><p>The giant spiders creep about in groups of three. Additional forces stationed here include a male drow elite warrior named Ranaghax Auvryndar, twelve male drow, three grimlocks, and three quaggoths. If an alarm is raised, these forces gather with the giant spiders to seek out and destroy intruders.</p><p>Buildings not keyed on the map are assumed to be empty rooms. The rest are described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>20A. KITCHEN</head><p>Odor. The smell of meat stew wafts from this building. Servants and Guards. Inside, a manacled bugbear and three goblins shackled together by the ankles are preparing meals under the watchful eye of three male drow guards named Raelphar, Rizryn, and Xebyl. Furnishings. Stone counters are spread throughout the room. A large cauldron is hung above a fire in the southwest corner.</p><p>Raelphar carries a key to the bugbear's manacles, and Rizryn has a ring of keys that unlock the goblins' shackles. Without these keys, a successful DC 15 Dexterity check made using thieves' tools opens each lock.</p><p>If <ref type="table" target="#tab_75">released from captivity, the goblinoids arm themselves with improvised weapons and flee to area 17a  by way of the south tunnel. The bugbear's name is  Blarg. The goblins' names are Globby, Bootlick, and  Earstabber.</ref> What~ for Dinner <ref type="table" target="#tab_75">? The s immering cauldron contains  a hearty stew of ripplebark fungus and troglodyte meat.</ref> 20B. <ref type="bibr">T'RISSA'S Q UARTERS</ref> Two male drow guards named Krivven and Yazdriirn stand outside the door. They deny entry to all but T'rissa and immediately attack intruders. The building holds the following features:</p><p>Stuffed Heads. Mounted to the walls are the stuffed heads of several bugbears, hobgoblins, and goblins. Chest. A locked chest of dark wood, carved in the likeness of a spider with eyes of red crystal, rests in the western alcove. (The key to the chest is hidden in the mouth of a mounted goblin head nearby.) Furnis hings. A bed with a canopy of spiderwebs fills the eastern alcove. Other furnishings include a dresser and a vanity that has an empty frame where the mirror should be.</p><p>The chest's lock can be picked by using thieves' tools and making a successful DC 15 Dexterity check, or opened with a knock spell or similar magic.</p><p>Treasure. The eight red crystal eyes on the chest can be pried loose and are worth 5 gp each. Inside the chest are three shelves stacked vertically.</p><p>The top shelf holds an onyx spider figurine (25 gp), eight sticks of incense (1 gp each), and a dagger with a tiny reservoir built into its hilt that holds up to three doses of a liquid poison.</p><p>The middle shelf contains a folded spider silk robe, dyed black, with tiny golden spiders sewn into it (90 gp). Hidden in the folds of the robe is a potion of healing in a crystal vial.</p><p>On the bottom shelf rests a birchwood wand (an arcane focus) and a leathe r-bound spellbook that belong to Marta Moonshadow (see area 5d). The book contains the following spells: chromatic orb, cone of cold, <ref type="bibr">counterspell, detect magic, dispel magic, enlarge/ reduce, fireball, fly, greater invisibility, ice storm, identify, mage armor, magic missile, magic weapon, misty step, polymorph, sending, shield, and suggestion.</ref> 20c. Q uAGGOTH D EN Three quaggoths, one of which is a quaggoth thonot (see the sidebar in the "Quaggoth" entry in the Monster Man ual), feast from a trough in the middle of this room. The trough contains bloody troglodyte entrails and other less identifiable fixings. Non-drow intruders are attacked on sight.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>20D. D EMON MIRROR</head><p>The door to this building is locked, and T'rissa Auvryndar (see area 6) carries the only key. The lock is old and can be picked by using thieves' tools and making a successful DC 12 Dexterity check.</p><p>The <ref type="table" target="#tab_45">building is full of cobwebs, and a 3-foot-tall oval  mirror hangs on the western wall. Eerily realistic spiders are carved into its stone frame, almost appearing  to twitch and crawl. When a creature approaches within  5 feet of its reflection in the mirror, the reflection disappears and is replaced with the shadowy face of a giant  spider obscured by smoke.  The creature in the mirror is a projection of a yochlol  demon in the service of T'rissa's mother. Vlonwelv. If the  figure standing before the mirror is T'rissa or someone  who looks exactly like her, the spider offers a warm  greeting in Elvish with its clicking mandibles and demands to know why efforts have been started to conquer  the Twisted Caverns (level 4)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>20E. TREASURE DOWNSTREAM</head><p>River of Fis h. A vein of turquoise runs through the east wall diagonally, looking like a stream. The granite in the vein has been carved to look like a school of trout. Stone Basin. A large, empty basin is carved into the floor at the northern end of the room.</p><p>The vein of turquoise runs from the top right corner of the east wall to the bottom left, heading down toward the empty basin. The trout carvings appear to be swimming upstream, away from the basin. Close examination of these carvings reveals that the fish can be rotated. The first time all the fish are turned so that they appear to be swimming downstream, a hidden valve in the basin opens and fills the container with 50 gallons of fresh water. Swimming in the water is a tiny emerald fish.</p><p>Treasure. The emerald fish swims around the basin until it is scooped out with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check, at which point the fish transforms into an elemental gem (water). The water remains in the basin after the fish is removed and does not drain away. Nothing happens if the trout carvings are rotated again.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>20F. UNOCCUPIED QUARTERS</head><p>Eleven padded bedrolls are spread throughout this room atop stone slabs. Each bed is paired with a small chest that doubles as a side table. The chests are unlocked and contain simple black clothes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>20G. DROW BARRACKS</head><p>Twelve bedrolls are spread out on the floor of this room. Six off-duty male drow and a male drow elite warrior relax here, but they quickly snatch up their weapons at the first sign of trouble. The drow are named Alybbrin, Chasmas,Jarkorl, K'yordred, Szorth. and Xebrek. The drow elite warrior, Ranaghax Auvryndar. is regaling the other drow with a reenactment of a one-on-one battle he had with a hobgoblin captain of the Legion of Azrok, which ended with the captain catching Ranaghax's poisoned blade in the neck. His telling of the tale is loud enough to be heard by characters listening at the door.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">. Ranaghax wears an obsidian scarab   brooch inscribed with the insignia of House Auvryndar  (25 gp), and he carries 35 gp in a web pouch.</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>20H. OLD DINING HALL</head><p>Lanterns. Anchored to the rafters by short chains are four unlit iron lanterns. Fur nishings. A solid stone table fills the west side of the room. The table, sized for dwarves, has shorter legs than most. Stone benches run the length of the table on either side, and a single stone chair stands at each end.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="201.">WATER CLOSET</head><p>A male drow named Balok sits on a latrine bucket in this chamber and is embarrassed to be caught in such a compromising position. If the characters attack him, he tosses the bucket at one of them as a distraction and flees to area 20g. (Treat the bucket as an improvised weapon that deals no damage but douses the target in stinky filth on a hit.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>20J. TROGLODYTE MOB</head><p>A horrible stench fills this chamber, the floor of which is covered with loose rocks. Twelve captured troglodytes are confined to these quarters, but the guard stationed outside their door has s lipped away to area 20i. If anyone other than a drow opens the door, the troglodytes seize the chance to escape. On their turn, they try to stampede their way to freedom and are loud enough to trigger an alarm. Troglodytes that escape head south and disappear into the dark waters of the River Sargauth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>20K. GATHERING OF GRIMLOCKS</head><p>Ste nch. This room reeks of death and decay. Grimlocks. Three grimlocks are picking hair out of their teeth in the middle of the room. Detritus. The room is strewn with rocks, heaps of splintered armor, and broken weapons. (The armor and weapons were taken from dead goblinoids. None of this gear is salvageable.)</p><p>Characters who follow the scent of decay discover a pile of severed goblin and hobgoblin heads tucked behind a wall of rocks near the south end of the room.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="21.">AZROK'S HOLD</head><p>The largest unburied section of Stromkuhldur is held by the Legion of Azrok and is called Azrok's Hold. As rumors of Azrok's blindness spread quietly through the settlement, fears mount of an impending attack from the drow in Stromkuhldur or from Skullport. A shroud of gloom and anxiety hangs over the normally raucous settlement, which has the following features:</p><p>Ruins. The 30-foot-high cavern is a maze of single-story stone buildings, many of which have partially col-lapsed. Most of the buildings have 10-foot-high walls and no roofs. Streets <ref type="table" target="#tab_75">. The narrow "streets" between the buildings  are strewn with trash and filth. Harmless rats scurry  around every corner.  Banners. Hanging from several structures are tattered  yellow banners bearing Azrok's sigil, a bloody handprint inside a hollow red triangle.  Patrols. Four bands of hobgoblins patrol Azrok's  Hold. Each patrol consists of three hobgoblins and a  hobgoblin captain, who interrogates visitors and demands to see their identification papers.</ref> Visitors entering Azrok's Hold are greeted by two bugbears. Drow are attacked on sight. Others may enter and move through Azrok's Hold, provided they have the proper identification papers. Visitors without papers are escorted by the bugbears to area 21c for processing.</p><p>Once each party member has papers, the bugbears take the characters to see Azrok in area 2l n. This meeting is not optional, since tribute must be paid to the hobgoblin warlord in return for his hospitality. Afterward, characters can move freely about Azrok's Hold, coming and going as they please. (Visitors need to register again only if they lose their papers.) If the characters wander the streets on their own, use the Random Encounters in Azrok's Hold table as needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RANDOM ENCOUNTERS IN AZROK'S HOLD dlO Encounter</head><p>Halaster's scrying eye (see "Halaster's La ir," page 311), which observes the characters silently fo r a minute before disappearing 2 A goblin child (noncombatant) eating a dead rat 3 A goblin hauling a bucket of garbage to area 17e 4 ld4 goblins with shovels, either digging through rubble or heading to a dig site S ld3 bugbears who sneer at visitors and make rude comments as they pass by 6 A bugbear with an intellect devourer in its skull that tries to lure characters to area 21 f 7</p><p>Preeta Kreepa (see area 21 m) 8-10 Three hobgoblins and a hobgoblin captain keeping the peace and checking visitors' identification papers</p><p>Combat behind closed doors probably doesn't raise an alarm, but any loud disturbance in the streets is likely to put the entire settlement on alert. As it happens, the Legion of Azrok's military has been winnowed down by recent a ltercations with the drow. The current defenders of Azrok's Hold include eight bugbears, thirty-two goblins, twenty hobgoblins, four hobgoblin captains (including Lurkana), Azrok the hobgoblin warlord, and two worgs. These forces don't include goblinoids in league with the Xanathar Guild or other visitors, nor do they include noncombatants such as children.</p><p>Buildings not keyed on the map are assumed to be empty rooms. The rest are described below. Princess Doll. One of the items in Kinrob's junk pile is a sackcloth doll with button eyes and a gold cloth tiara with tiny gemstones sewn into it (2 gp). The characters can trade for this item like any other and return it to its proper owner (see area 2lb).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>21B. SAD HuGGYBUG</head><p>Huggybug, a goblin child, cries alone in a rubble-strewn passageway. Between sobs, she explains that a n older goblin stole her princess doll and traded it for a shovel from the "Gob Gobbler." If the characters ask where the toy was taken, she leads them to area 21a but fearfully refuses to go inside.</p><p>Treasure. If the characters return the doll to Huggybug, she gives them a turquoise dolphin figurine (25 gp) in gratitude.</p><p>2lc. <ref type="bibr">REGISTRATION CENTER</ref> Clerks. Six goblins with ink quills sit behind a row of makeshift desks, ready to scribble the names of visitors into dog-eared ledgers and issue identification papers. Glowing oil lanterns hang above each desk from chains anchored to the ceiling. Manager. A hobgoblin wearing cracked half-moon spectacles sits behind a stone lectern and greets all those who enter, directing each new arrival to one of the available goblin clerks.</p><p>Visitors are required to carry identification papers at all times in Azrok's Hold. The goblins behind the desks interview visitors, draw crude pictures of them, and fill out papers with their names, races, ages, heights, eye color, skills, and home cities. The same information is also entered in a large ledger. Inquiries about other visitors are met with silent stares, because the goblins have instructions not to reveal any of the information.</p><p>Once all the characters are registered and have identification papers, the hobgoblin behind the lectern rings a bell, and two bugbears appear to escort the visitors to area 2ln, where they are expected to pay deference to Warlord Azrok. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>21F. BRAIN-DOG KENNEL</head><p>The mind flayer ambassador (see area 21g) has been luring goblinoids into this building and implanting intellect devourers in their skulls. The chamber has the following features:</p><p>Wreckage. The floor is strewn with wrecked furniture and broken crates. Goblins. Feeding on rats in the middle of the room are two goblins and a goblin boss, all with intellect devourers implanted in their skulls. Brain-Dogs. Two more intellect devourers hide among the wreckage. They target intruders with their Devour Intellect action option.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>21G. XANATHAR'S AMBASSADOR</head><p>A mind flayer named Ulquess resides here, serving as the ambassador from Skullport. Ulquess has been implanting intellect devourers in the skulls of goblinoids, turning them into spies loyal to Xanathar. If its plot is discovered, the mind flayer has no choice but to telepathically summon its thralls from area 21f to kill anyone who knows its secret. (It hides the bodies in area 22.) The room's centerpiece consists of two elegant chairs made of petrified wood arranged atop a circular rug. On a slender table between the chairs is a makeshift, threetiered Dragonchess set assembled from myriad pieces of other sets. The mind flayer conducts business here while seated casually in one of the chairs.</p><p>If the characters are meeting with the ambassador at Lurkana's urging (see "Side Quest: Retrieve Azrok's Dagger," page 44), the mind flayer politely discourages them from visiting Skullport, claiming that it's not safe for adventurers. It also tells them an Undermountain secret, hoping they'll be lured away by the mystery. Draw a card from the Secrets Deck (see appendix C).</p><p>Treasure. A thorough search of the room yields an unlocked iron coffer containing 100 gp that the ambassador uses for bribes. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>21K. CAPTAINS' BARRACKS</head><p>The furnishings were cleared out of this room to make space for nine wooden cots. Two hobgoblin captains rest here between patrols.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>21L. VISITORS' QUARTERS</head><p>This chamber is identical to area 2li.</p><p>21M. PREETA KREEPA Dug out of a mostly collapsed section of Stromkuhldur is a stone hovel in a cave lit by continual flame spells cast in several old cauldrons lying among the rubble.</p><p>The door to the hovel is ajar, and harmless rats scurry in and out in a constant stream. Inside the hovel, feeding bits of juicy moss to the rats, is a mage named Preeta Kreepa. She served as an assistant to Arcturia, one of Halaster's apprentices, until Arcturia transformed her into a monstrous horror. Preeta looks like an old woman with two beholder eyestalks sprouting from her eye sockets. Her mouth, twice as large as it should be, is filled with sharp, pointed teeth. She wears the flayed, slippery, translucent skin of a kuo-toa as a cloak.</p><p>For years, the Legion of Azrok left Preeta alone. Now the growing hostilities with the drow have prompted Azrok to call on her for help. Preeta understands the threat posed by the drow and is using animate dead spells to raise drow corpses, creating forces that Azrok can call upon to bolster his defenses. She keeps these undead warriors locked in area 2lq.</p><p>Preeta is a mage, with these changes:</p><p>• Preeta is chaotic neutral.</p><p>• She has darkvision out to a range of 120 feet, and she speaks Common, Dwarvish, Goblin, and Undercommon. • As a bonus action or a reaction, she can shoot one of the following eye rays at one target she can see within 120 feet of her:</p><p>Fear Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>Paralyzing Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>If the characters promise not to harm her, Preeta shares two Undermountain secrets with them. Determine each secret by drawing a card from the Secrets Deck (see appendix C). Treasure. Preeta carries a spellbook bound in lizard hide that contains all the spells she has prepared, plus animate dead, animate objects, and fabricate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="21">N. AZROK'S HALL</head><p>Two hobgoblins stand guard outside this building, one in front of each door. They a llow registered visitors to enter after checking their identification papers.</p><p>This structure once housed a dwarven smithy, and the decor suggests as much. Its contents are as follows:</p><p>Azrok and Lurkana. In the northeast part of the room, Azrok the hobgoblin war lor d sits on a throne of bleached skulls , with one foot resting on an iron anvil and one hand on the pommel of his greatsword. He wears a helm that covers most of his face and darkens his eyes. Whispering in his ear is his wife Lurkana, a formidable hobgoblin captain. Goblinoids. Attending the warlord are two bugbears, four hobgoblins, and six goblins. One of the bugbears has an intellect devourer hidden in its skull and acts as a spy for Xanathar while feigning loyalty to Azrok. Worgs. Gnawing on humanoid bones in the southwest part of the room are two worgs loyal to Azrok and Lurkana.</p><p>Adventurers brought before Azrok are expected to offer tribute. He is more interested in oaths of fealty than in tangible gifts, but he accepts whatever he's offered. Unless the characters make fools of themselves, Azrok grants them his protection for the duration of their stay in his settlement. Any character who interacts with him and succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom (Insight) check realizes that the hobgoblin warlord is blind but is hiding that fact, never looking directly at anyone. The characters also see a ghastly pendant on a cord around his neck-a severed human finger that wears a platinum signet ring (see "Lord Rosznar's Ring" below).</p><p>When the characters are done speaking with Azrok, Lurkana takes them aside and offers them a quest (see "Side Quest: Retrieve Azrok's Dagger," page 44). If they refuse, Lurkana scowls and kicks them out.</p><p>If combat breaks out, the hobgoblins stationed outside immediately raise a general alarm, causing all forces loyal to Azrok to converge on the area. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>21P. ARCH GATE TO LEVEL 6</head><p>Embedded in the west wall of this otherwise empty chamber is an arch gate to level 6 (see "Gates," page 12). The keystone of this arch is carved to look like a gold dragon wyrmling, its mouth agape. The rules of this gate are as follows:</p><p>• The gate opens for 1 minute when a gemstone worth at least 100 gp is placed in the dragon's mouth, which causes the dragon head to animate and chomp down on the gem (destroying it). • Characters must be 9th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12). • A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 36c on level 6, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>21Q.. MORGUE</head><p>Nine drow zombies stand perfectly still in the middle of this room, which is cluttered with cobwebs, rubble, and wreckage. The zombies obey Preeta Kreepa (see area 2lm) and attack anyone else who gets too close.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>21R. AZROK AND LURKANA'S QUARTERS</head><p>Standing in front of the door to this chamber is a tired goblin named Salt Nose, so named because he has white freckles on his broad snout. He's suffering from three levels of exhaustion and is trying to keep a 10-foot pole steady with trembling hands. From the top of the pole hangs Azrok' s banner: a bloody handprint inside a hollow red triangle on a sheet of yellow-dyed flesh. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="23.">WAY TO SKULLPORT</head><p>Weakened by the drow, the Legion of Azrok now fears incursions from Skullport. Azrok has placed sentries here to watch for trouble.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>23A. RIPPLEBARK CAVERN</head><p>Gua rds. Five hobgoblins stand watch in the middle of this 20-foot-high cave. Fungus. A shelf-like fungus resembling a mass of rotting flesh clings to the north wall. The fungus is called ripplebark (see "Ripplebark," page 60).</p><p>If the characters approach from the south, heading toward Azrok's Hold (area 21), the hobgoblins demand to know their business but allow them to pass if the group's intentions aren't hostile. If the party includes one or more drow, the hobgoblins attack instead. Characters traveling away from Azrok' s Hold aren't questioned, but they are warned not to harm the shriekers in area 23b.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>23B . IMMATURE SHRIEKERS</head><p>Conical Roof. This enormous cavern has a conical roof that rises to a peak 50 feet overhead. S pores a nd Gardens . The air is full of harmless, dimly luminescent spores that form clouds around gardens of moss and fungi. S hriekers. Planted among the other fungi are four Small (3-foot-tall) shriekers with 7 (2d6) hit points each, their locations marked with asterisks on map 3.</p><p>Characters who have encountered shriekers before can spot the young ones in this chamber with a successful DC 11 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Perception) check. Each shrieker cries out when a creature or a bright light comes within 30 feet of it, alerting the guards in area 23a.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AFTERMATH</head><p>If the forces of House Auvryndar are defeated but the Legion of Azrok remains, the goblinoids reclaim and fortify their lost caverns (areas 18 through 20). If the converse occurs and the Legion of Azrok is wiped out, the drow secure the rest of Stromkuhldur. If both factions are defeated, the level becomes a playground for explorers from Skullport.</p><p>Any good fortune visited upon the Legion of Azrok is temporary, as more of Azrok's goblinoids come under Xanathar's sway. Once the beholder has implanted intellect devourers in the s kulls of Azrok and Lurkana, it uses the Legion of Azrok as a bulwark to halt any drow advancement into Skullport. The sea hags of the River Sargauth join forces with Xanathar to hold the drow at bay.</p></div>

THIS</formula><p>level of Undermountain contains enough XP to advance such a group halfway to 9th level. The Twisted Caverns feature an aboleth, which is a legendary monster. Review the "Aboleth" entry in the Monster Manual before running this level of the dungeon to help you r un the monster effectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WHAT DWELLS HERE?</head><p>Control of this level is contested between an aboleth and a tribe of kuo-toa. The drow of House Auvryndar watch this conflict intently, waiting to see who comes out on top before making any push of their own. Various other Underdark species vie for a place in these caverns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ABO LETH</head><p>Illuun the aboleth, along with its pet chuuls and enslaved troglodytes, has taken over the lake cavern (area 16) and pushed the kuo-toa out. Its presence has tainted the underground river, killing off fish and other river dwellers that provide sustenance to the kuo-toa. Illuun plans to take over the entire level as a step toward gaining control of Undermountain and then Waterdeep.</p><p>The aboleth rarely leaves its watery lair and relies on its servants to capture new slaves.</p><p>A drow contingent led by a drow priestess of Lolth has holed up in areas 11 and 12. These forces report to T'rissa Auvryndar on level 3 and are preparing to challenge whoever perseveres in the conflict between the aboleth and the kuo-toa. These drow control access to one of the magic gates on this level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Kuo-TOA</head><p>The kuo-toa on this level were pushed out of the lake cavern (area 16) and away from their nesting caves (area 24) by the aboleth. They have taken refuge in areas 20 and 21 while the kuo-toa archpriest, Noolgaloop, creates an idol of a new god. The archpriest hopes the god will come to life and destroy the aboleth. Noolgaloop is using random items and the body parts of various creatures to craft the idol.</p><p>The kuo-toa don't trust drow and attack them on sight, but they tolerate non-drow adventurers who agree to help bring Noolgaloop's vile god to life or are willing to face the aboleth in battle.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RIPPLE BARK</head><p>This shelf-like fungus resembles a mass of rotting flesh, but it's surprisingly edible. Though it can be eaten raw, it tastes better roasted. A single sheet of ripplebark yields ld4 + 6 pounds of food.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TIMM ASK</head><p>Known as "devil's mushroom," a timmask is a 2-foot-tall toadstool with orange and red stripes across its beige cap. Uprooting or destroying a timmask causes it to expel a 15-foot-radius cloud of poisonous spores. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a creature is under the effect of a confusion spell with a duration of 1 minute. When the spell effect ends, the poisoned condition also ends.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>'TRILLIMAC</head><p>A trillimac is a mushroom that grows to a height of 4 to 5 feet and has a broad, gray-green cap with a light gray stalk. The cap's leathery surface can be cut and cleaned for use in making maps, hats, and scrolls; its surface takes on dyes and inks especially well. The stalk can be cleaned, soaked in water for an hour, then dried to make a palatable food akin to bread. Each trillimac stalk provides ld6 + 4 pounds of food.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TONGUE OF MADNESS</head><p>A tongue of madness looks like a large human tongue. Although it is edible, it holds no nutritional value. A creature that eats this fungus must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or compulsively speak aloud its every thought for the next hour. The effect can be ended with a lesser restoration spell or similar magic. ZURKHWOOD A zurkhwood is a mushroom that can grow up to 40 feet high. Its large, grain-like spores are edible (one specimen provides ld4 + 4 pounds of food), but the fungus is more important for its hard and woody stalk. Zurkhwood is one of the few sources of timber in the Underdark; it is used to make furniture, containers, bridges, and rafts, among other things. Skilled crafters can use stains, sanding, and polishing to bring out different patterns in a zurkhwood stalk. Characters who search for tracks and succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check find several large, bare footprints made by the ettin who regularly feeds on the mushrooms in this cavern.</p></div>

Barrelstalk, bluecap, and ripplebark fungi grow in irregular patches throughout the cavern.</p><p>The ettin's heads are named Jibber and Jabber, and they get along well-an unusual state of affairs for an ettin. This situation might be the result of the ettin's having a comfortable home and all the food it could desire. The ettin a lso has a friendly neighbor in the Alchemist (see area 4), who providesJibber-Jabber with compost that transforms the water in barrelstalk mushrooms into mead. The only thingJibber-Jabber is missing in its simple life is treasure to ogle. If the characters offer it 50 gp or more in coins, gems, and shiny art objects, the ettin allows them to pass through its domain and even harvest some fungus if they please. Jibber-Jabber might also impart the following useful information.</p><p>• "Spider people" (drow) are living in the caves to the east. They are new neighbors. • The "fishy folk" (kuo-toa) and the "stinky lizards" (troglodytes) seem troubled and are moving about more than usual. (The ettin has not yet encountered the aboleth and knows nothing about its conflict with the kuo-toa.) The water in the river has started to taste bad. (The ettin has not yet been poisoned by the water, which the aboleth has tainted with its presence.)</p><p>If the characters look like they could use more help, the ettin suggests they talk to the Alchemist and points them eastward.Jibber-Jabber describes the Alchemist as "smart, handsome, and small, but with a big smile."</p></div>

Its lair has the following features:</p><p>Gourds. The walls are set with shelves at various heights. They hold numerous gourds, most of which contain failed alchemical elixirs. Stone Block. A rough-hewn block of stone in the middle of the cave serves as a table. It is covered with a set of alchemist's supplies.</p><p>Almost a year ago, the green slaad was drawn to Undermountain, deprived of its control gem, and set loose by Halaster. It has explored several levels of the dungeon in its quest to find the gem. For now, it has adopted the guise of a scatterbrained, shabbily dressed young man who has, for reasons he would rather not divulge, set up an alchemist's lab in this cave. The slaad refers to itself only as "the Alchemist" and claims to have been kidnapped by Halaster from someplace it can't remember.</p><p>The Alchemist bargains with creatures for materials it needs, trading potions for fungi and equipment. What it's really looking for is its control gem, which it senses is close by (see area 21a). It doesn't want help finding the gem, though, for fear that the treasure might fall into the hands of those who try to control the slaad. If the characters obtain the gem and return it to the Alchemist, it cheers, turns invisible, and flees with the gem.</p><p>If the characters seem interested in knowing more about the Twisted Caverns, the slaad warns them about the ropers in area 6. Also, it has struck up a friendship with the "two-headed giant" in area 2 and urges the characters to speak with it, since it has lived on this level for a long time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POTIONS FOR SALE</head><p>The Alchemist is happy to trade potions for supplies. For one potion, it demands 20 pounds of edible fungi and five tongues of madness (which characters can harvest from the surrounding caves), plus 50 gp worth of adventuring gear. The Alchemist has no use for coins, gemstones, art objects, or magic items. Each time the characters pay the Alchemist a visit, it has one of each of the potions described below available to trade. Each potion is a common magic item. It keeps these potions on its person, and a sneaky character can try to pilfer one with a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the slaad's Wisdom (Perception) check. </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">LEVEL 4-I TWTSTED CAVERNS</formula></div>

Any creature that enters a square marked Ton the map has a 50 percent chance of breaking a strand and triggering a trap that releases rocks from a hidden crevice in the ceiling. If a trap triggers, all creatures occupying the trapped square must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a falling rock for 5 (ldlO) bludgeoning damage.

If she had her way, Melith would launch a full-scale assault on the kuo-toa, wipe them out, and then deal with the aboleth. As things are, she relies on her sister, T'rissa Auvryndar (see level 3), for soldiers, and T'rissa does not support such a strategy. So, armed with only a small force , Me!ith has been forced to watch and wait as the aboleth and the kuo-toa plot to annihilate one another.</p><p>Melith is happy to let adventurers meddle in the war between the aboleth and the kuo-toa.

If the characters slay the aboleth or the kuo-toa archpriest and return to her with proof of its demise, Melith promises to furnish them with a raft that they can use to navigate the underground river and continue their descent through Undermountain. Such a raft is stored in area 14, and Melith makes good on her promise.</p><p>Though she has great affection for Melith, Thirza sees any alliance with the characters as an opportunity to elevate herself in the eyes of Melith' s mother, Vlonwelv. After Melith concludes her business with the characters, Thirza prepares and casts a sending spell to contact Vlonwelv.

A svirfneblin druid inhabited this grove until a few months ago, when he felt threatened by the arrival of the aboleth and decided to follow the River of the Depths back down into the Underdark. Before he left, the druid cast awaken spells on seven zurkhwoods in the grove, three of which have s ince been felled by duergar axes and damage-dealing s pells.

Resting nearby are six 10-foot poles that the drow use to guide the rafts.</p><p>Although the darkmantles need to eat, they flee if reduced to half their hit points or fewer.</p><p>The drow use the rafts to ply the River of the Depths. Each raft is built to carry six Medium humanoids and their gear, though as many as twelve people can fit onto a raft if push comes to shove. Illuun the aboleth can sense the characters' presence and creates a magical projection of itself to interact with them.

It uses the projection to warn characters that it will not tolerate incursions into its domain and urges them to withdraw or face extermination. It suggests the characters take the south passage to the river, then follow the current down to Wyllowwood (level 5).

The kuo-toa named it Bulba-Slopp, and it served as their god until the aboleth came on the scene.

The boot and the amulet are both magical:</p><p>• The boot is one of two boots of elven kind. A single boot is useless without its companion. The matching boot was swept downriver and eventually found by a goblin werebat named Vool (see level 5, area 17). • The amulet controls the wandering shield guardian on level 1 (see "Shield Guardian," page 14).

If the characters try to speak with the archpriest in a language other than Undercommon, Noolgaloop casts the tongues spell so they can converse.

If the characters gather what it needs to complete the statue, Noolgaloop thanks them but decides on a whim to replace the statue's current head (a rusty lantern) with the head of one of the characters. Noolgaloop fully expects the character to make this sacrifice for the good of the kuo-toa tribe.</p><p>God Statue. The archpriest has already given its new god a name: Klaabu. This "god" sprawls on the slimy floor and consists primarily of a decapitated limestone statue depicting a bare-chested male sea elf. Its hands have been replaced with troglodyte claws, and additional limbs have been added in the form of a bugbear's severed arms. A pair of rusty shortsword blades thrust outward from the statue's breast, and it wears a kilt of green moss. A rusty lantern serves as the god's head, inside which rattles a fist-sized green gem-the control gem for the green slaad in area 4.

Experience has taught them to avoid contact with large, well-armed groups. A party of adventurers moving through the cavern with light sources is enough to keep the hook horrors at bay, as they click and chirp eerily to one another from the shadows.</p><p>It's only a matter of time before the aboleth enslaves the hook horrors or drives them off. The hook horrors have yet to encounter the aboleth and thus don't realize the danger it represents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="23">. HOOK HORROR LARDER</head><p>Ambush. A hook horror clings to a 15-foot high ledge,</p><p>waiting to ambush any who enter. The ledge is set into the western wall, between the two tunnel entrances. Bones. Lying on the floor are the bones of several troglodytes mingled with the remains of kuo-toa and other unidentifiable humanoids. Characters who search the bones find a lost treasure (see "Treasure" below). Fungi. Patches of barrelstalk, ripplebark, timmask, and tongue of madness grow near the water that pools against the eastern wall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TREASURE</head><p>Amid the bones is a common wondrous item called a pipe of smoke monsters. While smoking this pipe, one can use an action to exhale a puff of smoke that takes the form of a single creature, such as a dragon, a flumph, or a froghemoth . The form must be small enough to fit in a 1-foot cube. It loses its shape after a few seconds, becoming an ordinary puff of smoke. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>24A. WEST SENTRIES</head><p>Three enslaved troglodytes guard this 30-foot-high cave. Shattered shields, broken spears, and torn nets (trophies taken from the kuo-toa) lie heaped against the walls. None of this gear is salvageable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>24B . Kuo -TOA BONES</head><p>This 30-foot-high cave is littered with the bones of four kuo-toa. The bones have all been thoroughly chewed and their marrow sucked out.</p></div>

Unless they've been drawn elsewhere, twelve enslaved troglodytes rest atop sawed-off stalagmites in the middle of this 40-foot-high cave. Pictographs. The walls bear pictographs of kuo-toa abasing themselves before a creature that resembles an otyugh (a bulbous monster with three legs, long tentacles, and a gaping maw).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>24D. ABANDONED NURSERY</head><p>The kuo-toa used this 30-foot-high cave as a nursery. The cave has been empty since the kuo-toa were forced to vacate it. Tiny fish bones litter the floor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>24E. EAST SENTRIES</head><p>The underground river is loudest here. Three enslaved troglodytes guard this 30-foot-high cave.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AFTERMATH</head><p>This level has the potential to be greatly changed by the actions of the characters. The death of the aboleth allows the surviving kuo-toa to reclaim their grotto (area 16). The kuo-toa victory is short-lived, however, because the drow start attacking them soon afterward. These attacks continue until the kuo-toa are wiped out or forced to retreat upriver. After taking over the grotto, the drow enslave the troglodytes and use them to farm areas 3 and 5. Meanwhile, the drow move the grotto' s treasures to a more secure location, such as the House Auvryndar stronghold on level 10.</p><p>If the aboleth survives, it enslaves or kills off the remaining kuo-toa in the coming weeks. The aboleth also enslaves the ettin in area 2, and its slime poisons and kills off the fungi throughout the Twisted Caverns, destroying the delicate ecosystem. The drow challenge the victorious aboleth but are unable to defeat it on their own, given the limited support they receive from House Auvryndar. Several quaggoths that were once loyal to the drow become the aboleth's thralls. The resulting stalemate makes the drow desperate for aid, regardless of the source.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LEVEL 5: WYLLOWWOOD</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>YLL0WW00D IS DESIGNED FOR FOUR 8TH-LEVEL</head><p>characters. Those who defeat the monsters on this level should gain enough XP to reach 9th level. In some cases, defeating a monster can be accomplished without slaying it. If the characters strike a truce with a creature, award them XP as if they had defeated it in combat. The characters will most likely arrive here by way of the River of the Depths, which they first encounter on level 4. Characters who follow the river must navigate rapids and small waterfalls to reach Wyllowwood. Beyond this level, the River of the Depths begins its lengthy, tumultuous descent into the Underdark-a voyage no ordinary boat or raft can survive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MAGIC OF WYLLOWWOOD</head><p>In addition to dark caverns, this level contains forests of trees like those that grow on the surface. These temperate forests were magically created by HaJaster, and the sky high above can fool adventurers into thinking they have escaped Undermountain and found their way back to the surface. Birds, insects, and tree-dwelling mammals live here alongside Wyllowwood's fiercer denizens.</p><p>The forests are real and nourished by magic, and Halaster regularly repopulates them with birds, insects, rodents, and larger mammals. The main caverns have 100-foot-high ceilings hidden by illusions that can't be dispelled. These illusions begin 30 feet above ground and create the impression of open sky where high walls and ceilings should be. The illusions flawlessly duplicate the sun, the moon, the stars, and clouds, though there is no wind or breeze to speak of. During the day, the warmth of the sun can be felt, and at night the temperature drops as one would expect. Despite appearances, the walls and ceilings are still very much in place, and a true seeing spell or similar magic reveals them.</p><p>A magic calendar stone in area 6k allows one to change the time of day, the weather, and the season in Wyllowwood's forests. Wyllow the archdruid (see "What Dwells Here?" below) is the only one permitted to use the calendar stone. When the characters first arrive, Wyllowwood is enjoying a warm autumn-Wyllow's favorite season.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WHAT DWELLS HERE?</head><p>An archdruid named Wyllow lives in a tower on this level of the dungeon (in area 6), though she frequently wanders the woods. Her neighbors include a green dragon suffering from an identity crisis and a village of goblin werebats.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>W YLLOW</head><p>Wyllow is a moon elf druid with eyes as green as emeralds. Butterflies nest in her tangled black hair, and small critters gather around her feet.</p><p>Over two hundred years ago, Wyllow fell in love with Yinark, a wizard in league with Halaster, and returned with him to Undermountain. Her happiness faded quickly when the dungeon proved to be a far cry from </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WYLLOW'S STATISTICS</head><p>Wyllow is a moon elf a rchdruid (see appendix A), with these changes:</p><p>• Wyllow is chaotic neutral.</p><p>• She has these racial traits: Her walking speed is 35 feet. She has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. She has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put her to sleep. She speaks Common, Druidic, and Elvish.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VALDEMAR (TEARULAI)</head><p>This young green dragon, once a lawful evil creature, experienced a change in alignment and personality when an adventurer impaled it through the skull with a sentient, emerald-bladed sword of shai:pness named Tearulai. The dragon now refers to itself as Tearulai and has the longsword's neutral good alignment. It sleeps atop a platform overlooking the River of the Depths, guarding its treasure. Wyllow once set adventurers against Valdemar, hoping to destroy the evil dragon, but the dragon's change of alignment caused Wyllow to reconsider their relationship. Now that Valdemar and Tearulai are one, the archdruid considers the dragon part ofWyllowwood's ecosystem. The two currently enjoy a peaceful coexistence. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WANDERING MONSTERS</head><p>Wyllowwood is a thriving ecosystem. The woods support awakened shrubs, awakened trees, bats, bears, blink dogs, boars, deer, elk, rodents, small birds, and other denizens of temperate forests. Carrion crawlers, ettercaps, giant spiders, and owlbears make occasional forays into the woods as well.</p><p>If your game session needs a jolt, try using one of the following encounters or an encounter of your own design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BEAR WITH Us</head><p>A timid black bear shadows the characters, hoping to scavenge a tasty offering. If they feed the bear, it follows them like a companion and expects to be fed regularly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TREE BELIEVERS</head><p>As the heroes pass through the forest, two awakened t rees interrogate them in Common, demanding to know the reason for their intrusion. If the characters are looking for shelter, safe passage to deeper levels of Undermountain, or information, the trees offer to escort them to Wyllow's tower (area 6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VOOL THE OUTCAST</head><p>A rash of attacks against the deer of the forest threatened to turn Wyllow against her goblin werebat neighbors until it was revealed that the culprit of all the bloodletting was a single goblin we rebat (see appendix A) named Vool. To appease the archdruid, the other werebats drove Vool out of their village. He found a secluded cave nearby (see area 17) and took refuge there. He ventures out once a day to feed but avoids contact with his kin.</p><p>If Vool catches sight of the party, he tries to feed on a lone straggler. If captured or cornered, he apologizes for his uncontrollable blood lust and offers to make amends by serving as a faithful guide. He's lonely and genuinely in search of companionship, but be is without honor or decency. In an attempt to win favor and distract the characters from his own shortcomings, Vool tries to turn them against Wyllow, painting the archdruid as a creature of pure madness and malevolence. He also shares rumors of "great treasures" that are hidden inside Wyllow's tower.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">RIVER OF THE DEPTHS</head><p>Large blind fish swim up and down this dark, sluggish river that flows from level 4 and meanders down to the Underdark, plunging over waterfalls every mile or so.</p><p>The river's depth varies from a few feet to as much as 30 feet in spots. Characters who trawl the depths for treas ure might find the odd bauble here and there, or possibly something more dangerous like a sleeping hydra.</p><p>At various points along the river are crude wooden signs, each one carved with the word "Underdark" in Goblin and an arrow pointing downriver.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">FOREST</head><p>Between the forest and the underground river are narrow, pebbled beaches upon which Wyllow has planted carved wooden signs that bear the following warning in Common, Draconic, and Elvish: BEHOLD WYLLOW'S WOOD. HARM NOT, LEST YE BE HARM'D.</p><p>General features of the forest a re s ummarized in the "Forest Features" sidebar. Specific regions are described in the sections that follow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2A. RIVERSIDE FOREST</head><p>The trees growing alongside the river are some of the biggest in Wyllowwood. Their gnarled boughs form a tangled canopy that overhangs the pebbled beaches. Bears come to the river's edge to fis h, and deer and elk come to drink a nd bathe.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2B . ETTERCAP FOREST</head><p>The trees in this part of the forest are shrouded with thick webs, and dead animals wrapped in silken cocoons hang from the boughs. Five ettercaps and ten giant spider s live in the trees and attack interlopers. Wyllow considers these creatures to be part of Wyllowwood's natural ecosystem but keeps them from spreading beyond the marble walkways to the west and south.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2C. MOANING FOREST</head><p>Characters passing through this part of the forest can see Wyllow's tower (area 6) through the trees and hear an eerie moa n coming from the northwest. (The source of the incessant moaning is the cloaker in area 4e.) 2o. OLD GRAVE Thin rays of sunlight or moonlight penetrate the dense canopy of this old forest, whose trees are covered with moss.</p><p>At night, a will-o'-wisp lures adventurers to a grave in the middle of this cavern. The grave stands amid a grove of dead, burned trees. It is marked with a headstone that reads in Common, "Here lies Crissann, human friend and companion." The top of the gravestone is carved in the shape of a rose. A detect magic spell cast in the vicinity reveals a source of evocation magic buried in the earth (see "Treasure" below). The will-o'-wisp is Crissann's disembodied spirit. During the day, it hovers invisibly over the grave. With a whispery voice, it says, in Common, "Take my wand. Use it to destroy Wyllow, the elf witch!" If the characters obtain the wand from the grave, the will-o'-wisp tries to lead them to Wyllow's tower and a showdown with the archdruid. If the characters refuse to avenge Crissann, the will-o'-wisp attacks them. Otherwise, it considers the characters its allies. IfWyllow is defeated, the willo'-wisp is overcome with despair and turns against the party, fighting until destroyed.</p><p>Treasure. Characters who dig up the grave find a human skeleton clad in tattered clothes and a fully charged wand of fireballs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2E. WESTERN FOREST</head><p>The forest continues off the map a nd follows the underground river for several hundred feet. The forest floor is littered with statues of birds a nd mammals, creatures petrified by a basilisk that wanders these woods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">GUARDHOUSES</head><p>Two windowless stone guardhouses with peaked, slatetiled rooftops stand in the middle of the forest where several elevated walkways converge. The buildings were built on higher ground than the surrounding forest, and their stone doors are unlocked.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3A. NORTH GUARDHOUSE</head><p>A rusty lantern hanging from a rafter has a continua/ flame spell cast on it, brightly illuminating a musty room that contains four wooden beds with moldy mattresses. At the foot of each bed is an empty, overturned chest. The halfling adventurer, Haddon Fleetfoot, refused to serve the will-o'-wisp in area 2d and barricaded himself in this guardhouse, believing that act would prevent the will-o'-wisp from reaching him. An examination of his corpse and a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check reveals that he died from several lightning shocks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3B. SOUTH GUARDHOUSE</head><p>Arch Gate to Level 2. The stone arch is one of Halaster's magic gates (see "Gates," page 12). Its stone frame has been carved to look like the trunks of trees, and close inspection reveals the image of a dead tree carved into its keystone. Its rules are as follows:</p><p>• Touching the arch with a dead twig or branch causes the gate to open for 1 minute. • Characters must be 6th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12). • A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 12 on level 2, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.</p><p>Treasure. Haddon's corpse wears a salvageable suit of halfling-sized leather armor. It clutches a silvered shortsword in one hand and a burnt torch stub in the other. A search of the corpse yields a dungeoneer's pack with spoiled rations and 5 torches remaining, and a small pouch containing 4 gp.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">CLOAKER D EN</head><p>A conclave of cloakers has taken over this series of caverns. Wyllow has tried to frighten off the cloakers, so far without success. A persistent, eerie moan emanates from area 4e and can be heard throughout this complex and well into the surrounding forest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4A. EASTERN GATE</head><p>A 15-foot-high iron portcullis is embedded in the stone wall at the mouth of a long tunnel. Rough-hewn stairs just inside the tunnel climb to the top of the wall, which is enclosed by stone battlements. There are no guards stationed atop the wall or beyond the portcullis. The winch to raise the portcullis is inside the tunnel, just beyond the gate. The portcullis can also be lifted with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4B-C. SIDE CAVES</head><p>Two cloakers lurk here, one in each cave. They team up against intruders. If one is killed, the other retreats to area 4e and joins the cloaker there. The caves are bereft of furnishings and treasure. The cloaker is using its moan to draw others of its kind to this location, hoping to form a conclave. If the cloaker detects interlopers, it creates phantasmal duplicates of itself, emerges from the crack in the ceiling, and attacks.</p><p>The crystal formations reflect and amplify nearby light. The crystals also amplify sound, allowing it to carry well beyond the cavern's confines. The crystals otherwise have no properties or value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">INNER F O REST</head><p>A thorough exploration of this part of the forest reveals several items of note:</p><p>Litter. The forest is strewn with rusty weapons, burnt torch stubs, empty bottles, and other worthless paraphernalia left behind by adventurers. Druidic Totems. Eerie totems hang from the trees.</p><p>Made from twigs, feathers, and tattered bits of cloth, they look like crude dolls. (Each one is modeled after a humanoid Wyllow has killed.)</p><p>General features of the forest are summarized in the "Forest Features" sidebar. Characters who engage in wanton destruction are accosted by several creatures, each of which has been the recipient of an awaken spell: four awakened trees, an awakened br own bear, two awakened elks, and three awakened giant wasps. These creatures are loyal servants of the archdruid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">WYLLOW'S TOWER</head><p>Wyllow's Tower is carved to look like a squat stone tree with twisted, stony boughs protruding from the walls. Thirteen giant bats hang from these crumbling limbs like ornaments, their wings wrapped tightly around their bodies. If the characters try to climb the tower, the bats attack. The bats otherwise fight only in self-defense or at Wyllow's command.</p><p>At the base of the tower, on the south side, is a 12-foothigh arched double door made of carved stone. A rope hanging next to the door rings a bell when tugged. If the characters knock or ring before entering, Wyllow's For information on Wyllow, see the "Wyllow" section at the start of the chapter. The archdruid is friendly toward visitors who have done nothing to anger her. The displacer beast and the awakened tree fight to the death to defend her.</p><p>Characters who do nothing to antagonize Wyllow can secure safe passage through her demesne, though she warns them to steer clear of the goblin werebats and show the green dragon the respect it's due. She knows the locations of Wyllowwood's gates and how to activate them (see areas 3b, 6i, and 9), as well as the passages leading down to levels 6 and 7. If the characters slay the cloakers north of her tower (in area 4), Wyllow will share this information with them.</p><p>Treasure. The gold key in Wyllow's possession unlocks the chest in area 6g. The key is worth 25 gp.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6B . HIDDEN ARMORY</head><p>Frescoes. The walls bear frescoes that depict skirmishes between surface elves and drow, culminating in an epic showdown with Lolth in the Demonweb Pits. Frescoes. The walls are carved with frescoes depicting exchanges of gifts between dwarves and elves. Staircase. A stone spiral staircase in the northwest corner curls up 10 feet to area 6e and continues up another 10 feet to area 6h.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6D . HALL OF THE FOREST KING-DOM</head><p>A .flight of stairs connects this room to the lower floor. The room is empty except for frescoes on the walls depicting an elven forest kingdom.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6E . HALL OF THE SKY CHARIOTS</head><p>Frescoes. The walls are carved with frescoes that depict elves in cloud chariots pulled by fiery horses, coursing through the starry skies. Staircase. A stone spiral staircase in the northwest corner descends 10 feet to area 6c and climbs 10 feet to area 6h.</p><p>The stone door to area 6f has an arcane lock spell cast on it. A button carved in the shape of a twinkling s tar is hidden in a nearby wall fresco; a character who searches the wall spots it with a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check. When the star-shaped button is pushed, the door swings inward. The door can also be opened with a knock spell or forced open with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6F. WYLLOW'S STAFF OF FLOWERS</head><p>The door to this narrow room is magically locked from the outside (see area 6e) but pulls open easily from the inside. The room contains the following features:</p><p>Debris. Broken staffs litter the dusty floor. Treasure. The staff resting on the table is Wyllow's staff of flowers, a common magic item to which anyone can attune. While holding the staff, a creature can use an action to expend 1 charge from the staff and cause a flower to sprout from a patch of earth or soil within 5 feet of it, or from the staff itself. Unless a specific kind of flower is chosen, the staff creates a mild-scented daisy. Wyllow's staff is peculiar in that it can't create roses, which the archdruid dislikes. If a rose is chosen, a daisy grows instead. The flower is harmless and nonmagical, and it grows or withers as a normal .flower would. The staff has 10 charges and regains ld6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If its last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns into black rose petals and is lost forever. Treasure. A niche carved into the southeast wall holds a small wooden chest bearing painted images of worms burrowing out of the ground. Set into the chest is a magic lock whose tumblers adjust to confound burglars. A character using thieves' tools can pick the lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check, but the check is made with disadvantage. Inserting Wyllow's gold key (see area 6a) into the lock also opens the chest, as does a knock spell.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6G. SECRET ROOM</head><p>The chest conta ins a pair of sapphire earrings (250 gp apiece), an armband made of overlapping gold leaves (250 gp), a random trinket (roll on the Trinkets table in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook), and a crystal bulb as big as a pear. Inside the crystal bulb is a tiny effigy of Halaster Blackcloak. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around the bulb.</p><p>If the crystal bulb is planted in earth or soil on this level of Undermountain, it is destroyed as Halaster Blackcloak (see appendix A) sprouts from the ground where the bulb was buried. This is the real Halaster, delivered by his own magic. The Mad Mage entrus ted the bulb to Wyllow in case she needed to summon him and is annoyed if someone else uses it.</p><p>If the characters have done nothing aside from this to offend him, Halaster babbles about his current preoccupation (see "Halaster's Goals," page 11) and demands the characters do whatever they can to help him. He then teleports away in a huff. If the characters manage to get a word in edgewise, they might persuade him to share useful information before he leaves. He might, for example, divulge the secret to activating one of his many gates, or he might mention creatures known to dwell on one of the deeper levels of Undermountain. If the characters attack him, Halaster retaliates in kind.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6H. STATUARY</head><p>The spiral staircase reaches its peak in this room, which contains the following features:</p><p>Statues. Standing in alcoves to the north and south, facing one another, are green marble statues of 6-foottall, proud elf warriors clutching shields and spears. The shield of the northern statue features a pine tree, while an oak tree is emblazoned on the shield of the statue to the south. Frescoes. The walls are carved with frescoes of elves traveling through space aboard sleek wooden vessels with giant crystalline wings, visiting strange worlds and battling ores and dragons in space. Wyllow has slain scores of adventurers over the years, and she chooses to memorialize them with this ghastly ossuary, the walls and ceiling of which have humanoid skulls and bones cemented to them in decorative arrangements. A few bare patches have yet to be fi lled.</p><p>Secret Door. A secret door behind one bone-layered wall swings open into area 6k.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6K.CALENDARSTONE</head><p>This spacious room has been swept clean of dust and cobwebs. It contains the following:</p><p>Guards. Four giant toads lurk in the far corners of the room. They leap forward and attack anyone not accompanied by Wyllow. Calendar Stone. Set into the floor is a 15-foot-diameter stone device engraved with a multitude of images.</p><p>The device has a circular center 9 feet in diameter, around which are two concentric rings of stone. The center stone is fixed in place. Its engravings depict birds, butterflies, fish, and small mammals encircling Wyllow's smiling visage. Each ring is 3 feet wide and turns clockwise on hidden rollers. The inner ring is engraved with images of plants and animals weathering the change of seasons. The outer ring bears alternating engravings of the sun at various heights and the moon in all its phases. A fixture on the outer edge of the device is used to line up the rings and indicate the present time of day and season in Wyllowwood. The rings slowly turn on their own, tracking the natural changes that occur over time. By turning a ring manually, one can force a more sudden change from day to night or night to day, or bring the effects of a new season upon Wyllowwood.</p><p>If the characters change the time of day or the season, all the surviving werebats except Vool (see area 17) investigate Wyllow's tower in goblin form to find out what is amiss.</p><p>The calendar stone can't be damaged or dismantled. Arch Gate to Level 6. A door in the northeast corner leads to a smaller chamber with an arch gate set into the back wall (see "Gates," page 12). The arch is engraved with images of dancing dwarves. The rules of this gate are as follows:</p><p>• Standing within 5 feet of the arch and imitating the moves of the dancing dwarves causes the gate to open for 1 minute. The dance requires 1 minute to perform. • Characters must be 9th level or higher to pass through this gate (see '']hesiyra Kestellharp," 10).</p><p>The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12). • A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 10 on level 6, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.</p><p>Treasure. The treasures inside the building are as follows:</p><p>• 3,500 gp, 6,000 sp, and 15,000 cp in loose coinage • A 500 gp black pearl with a minor magical property (it glows faintly when undead are within 120 feet of it)</p><p>• A potion of gaseous form</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">• A spell scroll of heroes' feast GREEN DRAGON</formula><p>While asleep, the dragon relies on its passive Wisdom (Perception) score to detect the approach of intruders by scent and sound. The dragon feeds mostly on blind fish and prefers to be left alone. If attacked, it lets out a roar loud enough to be heard throughout Wyllowwood. Wherever she is, Wyllow hears the roar and comes to the dragon's defense. The dragon, Valdemar, refers to itself as Tearulai and won't willingly part with the sword stuck in its skull. Nor will it allow characters to enter the building or use the gate inside unless they have Wyllow's permission to do Evil creatures can't attune to Tearulai; any evil creature that tries to do so takes 20 psychic damage. The weapon's emerald blade can't be damaged or dulled, and the sword can't be teleported anywhere without its wielder while the two are attuned to one another.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spells.</head><p>The sword has 6 charges and regains ld4 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. A creature attuned to the sword can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells from it without material components: fly (2 charges), polymorph (3 charges), or transport via plants (4 charges).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sentience. The sword has an Intelligence of 17, a</head><p>Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 20. It has hearing and truesight out to a range of 120 feet. It communicates telepathically with its attuned wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common, Draconic, Elvish, and Sylvan.

Resting atop a marble bier in the middle of the room is a carved stone rocking cradle.</p><p>The frescoes depict Melair spending time with his wife, their children, and their children's descendants.</p><p>The cradle weighs 500 pounds and is an art object worth 2,500 gp. It contains a 2-foot-long statue of a swaddled dwarf infant sleeping soundly. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the statue of the dwarf infant. When the characters first enter this room, ghostly orbs of light arranged like the eyes of a beholder appear in the middle of the room. This spectral display is one of Halaster's harmless regional effects (see "Halaster's Lair," page 311) and lasts for 1 minute.</p></div>

The south wall bears a lavish carving of a mountain, beneath which a large stylized eye looks down on a line of dwarf warriors. Monsters. Five enlarged duergar occupy the 10-foot spaces in front of the carving, examining the mithral filigree. Two xorn stand watch in the middle of the hall, feeding on discarded mithral fragments. Broken Door. The door to the north has been reduced to rubble, creating an open passageway.</p><p>The occupants of this area are tenuous allies. The duergar attack anyone they don't recognize, and the xorn assist as best they can. If the duergar are defeated, the xorn disengage from combat on their next turn and flee by burrowing into the walls. If the xorn escape, the characters can encounter them again in other nearby chambers at your discretion. The xorn become indifferent toward characters who feed them gems and precious metals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TREASURE</head><p>The carving on the south wa ll is inlaid with mithral filigree.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14.">GRAND VESTIBULE</head><p>Rough Walls. The walls of this area are roughly hewn to give the room a cavern-like appearance. Quartz Pillars. The glow from four quartz pillars reflects off flecks of quartz embedded in the walls. Engraved Doors. The double doors to the south are engraved with the image of a mountain with a gemshaped indentation at its core (the symbol of Dumathoin). The edges of the indentation serve as handles that enable the doors to be pulled open. Secret Door. A secret door in the east wall opens into a dusty, cobweb-filled corridor that connects to area 13.

NAVE Monste rs. Eight duergar plus their leader, a half-shield dwarf, half-duergar named Skella Ironeye, are scattered throughout the area. Two cloakers flap above them, circling the nave at a height of 20 feet. The cloakers consider the duergar their allies. Quartz Pillars. Glowing quartz pillars stand around the temple perimeter, carved to look like natural columns. The glowing pillars have the appearance of buttresses, but only the four stone pillars in the middle of the nave support the roof. Da is. At the south end of the temple, stone steps climb 10 feet to a golden marble dais (area 15b).</p><p>Although her mother was a shield dwarf, Skella has the statistics of a duergar with 40 hit points. She has also attuned to a magic dagger that gives her blindsight out to a range of 30 feet (see "Treasure" below).</p><p>When Skella and her duergar subordinates climbed to the top of the dais, the altar there released a clay golem that attacked them (see area 15b). Four duergar were smashed to a pulp before Skella realized that their weapons were having no effect on the golem. She ordered her remaining forces to fall back, whereupon the golem withdrew to the altar once more.</p><p>Skella is prepared to let the adventurers take a crack at defeating the golem, so that she can find out what lies beyond the basalt doors. When the characters arrive, she tries to forge a truce with them, promising them safe passage through the Lost Level if they defeat the The altar is a block of clay 7 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet high. When any creature moves within 20 feet of it, an 8-foot-tall clay golem with dwarf-like proportions erupts from an extradimensional space inside the altar. The golem can exit or enter the a ltar as an action. The altar is impervious to damage.</p><p>The golem can't be reasoned with. It enters the altar again only if it perceives no threats on the dais. If it goes berserk, the golem abandons its role as guardian and leaves the dais in pursuit of fleeing creatures.</p><p>If the characters defeat the golem or lure it away, any duergar in the temple seize the chance to approach the black basalt doors and inspect them more closely.</p><p>Basalt Doors. These matte black doors are impervious to damage and held shut by a power that neither magic nor force can overcome. The doors appear to absorb all light, but a close inspection reveals Dwarvish inscriptions carved into them that translate as follows: "It is the will of the Keeper of Secrets under the Mountain that only the hand of the king may open these doors. Let all who enter gaze upon the heart of Melairbode and know the true power of dwarvenkind." Any character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (History) check knows that Melairbode is the name of the ancient dwarven realm beneath l.Vli;unt Waterdeep, whose Underhalls were the foundations of Undermountain. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="16.">HEART OF THE MOUNTAIN</head><p>The Melairkyn dwarves carved this 20-foot-high room out of the rock at the point they believed was the heart of their subterranean realm. The features of this room are as follows:</p><p>Door Handles. The black basalt doors leading to the dais (area lSb) have handles on this side and are easily pulled open from within. Mithra l Veins. Thin veins of mithral spread across the hewn walls, looking like gleaming cracks in the stone. Tapestry. A huge tapestry depicting a dwarven kingdom under a mountain hangs from an iron rail and spans the south wall. The tapestry is so old that it begins to crumble if any attempt is made to handle or move it. Mirror. A tall oval mirror is mounted on the east wall.</p><p>Carved into its stone frame are dozens of lidless eyes and the following phrase in Common: "The gate cannot hide from those it cannot see."</p><p>While in this room, dwarf characters can sense the immense weight of the mountain gently pressing down on them and realize subconsciously that they can attune to this room as though it were a magic item. A legend lore spell or similar magic reveals that this room sits at the heart of the mountain and that the Melairkyn dwarves came here to learn secrets and receive divine guidance.</p><p>While attuned to the room and inside it, a dwarf can cast the divination spell at will. Answers provided by the spell come from an unknown source (perhaps the Keeper of Secrets under the Mountain, perhaps the mountain itself). Too many castings of the spell in a short amount of time can lead to false readings, as noted in the spell's description.</p><p>Creatures that finish a short or long rest in this chamber absorb some of the strength of the mountain around them and gain 10 temporary hit points, or 20 temporary hit points if the creature is a dwarf. Once a creature gains this benefit, it can't do so again until the next dawn, and then only after finishing a short or long rest.</p></div>

The rules of this gate are as follows:</p><p>• Touching the arch with a nonmagical item made entirely of ferrous metal (such as an iron spike) reduces the item to powdered rust and opens the gate for 1 minute. • Characters must be 6th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10).

A black marble sarcophagus flecked with gold stands close to the south wall, its lid carved in the likeness of a dwarf king. Cr ystal Pa nels. Ten glittering panels are set into the west, south, and east walls. Each panel is a 6-foot-tall, 3-foot-wide, 1-inch-thick rectangle of golden crystal, carved with the bas-relief image of a dwarf warrior clutching a battleaxe. (The panel in the middle of the south wall is set into a secret door that swings open into area 29b.)</p><p>The lid of the sarcophagus can be lifted by creatures with a combined Strength of 20 or more. Removing the lid triggers a magic mouth •spell that admonishes interlopers in Dwarvish: "You dishonor our beloved king! May his tomb become yours as well!" After this warning, all ten battleaxes break free of their panels (whether on the walls or not; see "Treasure") and attack the tomb's interlopers. Use the flying sword statistics for each crystal battleaxe.</p><p>The sarcophagus contains tatters of a black shroud, the dust and bones of a nameless dwarf, and the bones of a mole that was accidentally sealed in with the dwarf's remains.</p><p>Treasure. The crystal panels can be carefully pried from the walls. Each panel weighs 50 pounds and is worth 500 gp, or 50 gp without its crystal battleaxe.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>29c. SECOND INTERSTITIAL HALL</head><p>This hall is choked with dust and cobwebs. It ends in a blank wall that holds a hidden secret door. The secret door is locked, and the mechanism to unlock it is located at the bottom of a hidden pit. The statues represent the dwarven deities Moradin (god of creation), Berronar Truesilver (god of hearth and home), Clangeddin Silverbeard (god of battle), and Marthammor Duin (god of exploration). A demon is trapped in each statue (see "Trapped Demons" below).</p><p>Each statue is a Large object with AC 15, 100 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Toppling a statue requires a successful DC 22 Strength (Athletics) check. A statue that topples or takes 10 or more damage cracks enough for the demon inside to erupt in a cloud of reeking black mist. It then coalesces into it~ true form in the nearest unoccupied space.</p><p>Trapped Demons. The Melairkyn dwarves trapped four demons in the statues after attempts to banish the fiends failed-a barlgura in the statue of Moradin, a hezrou in the statue of Berronar, a vrock in the statue of Clangeddin, and a glabrezu in the statue of Marthammor. Over the centuries of its confinement, the glabrezu has learned how to telepathically contact creatures in this room. Using its telepathy, it tries to trick an interloper into freeing it. Though the other three demons have telepathy, they are not powerful enough to use the ability while trapped in their statues. The glabrezu makes telepathic contact with one character at random, congratulating that character on making it this far and claiming to have the knowledge and power to reveal the way to King Melair's true tomb. It promises (truthfully) to do so in exchange for its release from captivity. If the glabrezu is released, it casts dispel magic on the wall behind the tapestry, granting access to areas 29e and 29f, then lets the characters desecrate King Melair's tomb before it attacks them. If it needs allies, it knocks over more of the statues to free the other demons. These weaker demons obey the glabrezu for as long as it benefits them to do so.</p><p>If the first character it approaches refuses to help the glabrezu escape, it makes contact with each of the other party members in turn. If it realizes none of the characters can be swayed, it screams vile epithets and vows to destroy them whenever it is set free.  </p></div>

Its keystone is carved to show a gold dragon wyrmling with its mouth open. Slaad. Two invisible gray slaadi in their natural forms flank the arch. The slaadi are Halaster's willing servants and attack anyone who approaches the arch or emerges from it, becoming visible as they do so. Bunk Beds. Four stone bunk beds are pushed against the long walls of the room.</p><p>The arch is one of Ha laster's magic gates (see "Gates," page 12). Its rules are as follows:</p><p>• The gate opens for 1 minute when a gemstone worth at least 100 gp is placed in the dragon's mouth. This act causes the mouth to animate, chomp down on the gem, and destroy it. • Characters must be 7th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12). • A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 2lp on level 3, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.</p></div>

A copper pipe extends upward from the tank and disappears into the ceiling. A fire e le menta l rages inside the tank. Iron Wheel. A small iron wheel protrudes from the wall just inside the door. Benches. Black marble benches hug the wall.</p><p>When cold water from an underground river is fed into the tank through the pipe, the fire elemental turns the water into s team. The steam billows out through vents in the cylinder's sides, making the room into a sauna.</p><p>The tank is a Large object with AC 11, 45 hit points, and immunity to fire, poison, and psychic damage.

Eight gemstones a re embedded in the stone rings the dwarf wears on its steepled fingers. Open Pit. In front of the s tatue is a 10-foot-deep open pit whose bottom is set with spring-loaded iron jaws, around which a re chunks of rock and dwarven bones.</p><p>A temple acolyte found this shrine but failed to notice the pit, which was hidden under a fa lse stone floor. When the fal se floor broke apart underfoot, the dwarf fell into the snapping iron jaws below. The false floor was never replaced, nor was the acolyte's body removed. The spring-loaded iron jaws rusted and froze over time.</p><p>Treasure. The dwa rf had a peg leg made of mithraJ (75 gp) but nothing else of value.</p><p>The gemstones set in the statue's stone rings include two sardonyxes (50 gp each), two zircons (50 gp each), an amethyst (100 gp), two garnets (100 gp each), a spine!

Four pieces of a shattered jade staff are encased behind glass in niches evenly spaced along the west wall. Each niche is 4 feet tall, 1 foot wide, 1 foot deep, and lit with ambient magical light. Secret Door. A secret door in the south wall opens into area 39c.</p><p>The glass encasing each niche is easily broken, allowing access to the fragment inside. Shattering the glass in a niche causes the light in that niche to go dark.</p><p>Treasure. The jade staff is presently broken into five 1-foot-long piecesthe four that Halaster placed on display here, plus a fifth piece he cast away. A detect magic spell reveals no magical auras around the staff fragments. Each of the staff's five pieces is worth 100 gp for the jade alone. The missing piece is the middle section of the staff, currently in the clutches of a bullywug (see level 8, area 19c). Pieces one and two (the top two sections of the staff) can be restored to a single section with a mending cantrip, as can pieces four and five (the bottom two sections).</p><p>If the fifth piece is found, the entire staff can be restored with mending cantrips; each casting of the spell repairs one break in the staff. If the staff is made whole, it transforms from an object into an animated jade serpent that has the statistics of a giant poisonous snake , with these changes:</p><p>The serpent is a construct that understands and obeys whoever was holding the staff when it transformed.</p><p>• It has immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition. It doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep. • When it drops to 0 hit points, roll a d6. On a roll of 1, the snake turns to dust and is destroyed.

In the mountain's heart, you'll find your own greatness." (See area 15.) • "When you enter a room, speak the word 'xunderbrok' for all to hear. You might be rewarded."

The room contains the following:</p><p>Quartz Pillars. Glowing quartz pillars stand in the corners of the room. Duergar. Two duergar are inspecting a stone arch embedded in the center of the east wall. Instruments. Protruding from the south wall is an organ whose pipes are carved out of stalagmites. Its bench and keys are made of polished gold and black marble. Two large copper kettle drums stand against the west wall. Resting atop them is a shiny brass tuba.</p><p>The duergar have taken a break from looting to inspect the arch in the east wall. They turn invisible if they detect other creatures approaching, then move up behind the pillars to the north to take stock of the new arrivals. Then they sneak off to area 15a to alert the duergar there. They avoid confrontation in this room. In addition to their weapons and armor, these duergar have treasure (see "Treasure" below). • Casting the mage hand cantrip and pressing its spectral fingers into the keystone' s indentation opens the gate for 1 minute. • Characters must be 11th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12). • A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 2b on level 11, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INSTRUMENTS</head><p>Any inspection of the room allows the characters to examine the instruments more closely. Brass Tuba. This bulky instrument is missing its mouthpiece, which characters can find in area 19. Without it, the tuba can't produce its deep, distinctive sound. The tuba is worth 30 gp and weighs 30 pounds. Kettle Drums. When struck, these two copper drums make a thunderous booming sound. Each drum is worth 50 gp and weighs 100 pounds. Stalagmite Organ. This monstrous pipe organ produces deep, earthy tones from its hollow stalagmites when its stone pedals are pumped and its marble keys are played. The music of the organ not only fills this room but also magically sounds throughout the temple (area 15), alerting the creatures there. If duergar are still present in the temple, four of them are sent to investigate the disturbance in this area and silence the music. The organ's stalagmites were part of the cavern from which this room was hewn, and thus they blend seamlessly with the surrounding floor and wall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T REASURE</head><p>Each duergar carries a sack of stolen items. One sack contains a silver figurine of an ox (25 gp), a tiny mithral bell (25 gp), and a pewter flagon sculpted in the shape of a gold dragon with amethysts for eyes (250 gp). The other sack contains a small trapezoidal mirror set in an onyx frame (25 gp) and a leather eye patch with a bloodstone (50 gp) sewn into it.</p></div>

Arch Gates. Two stone arches are embedded in the walls, one to the north and the other to the south. Stalkers. Halaster placed two invisible stalkers here.</p><p>They attack any creature that approaches within 10 feet of either gate or that emerges from a gate.</p><p>The male duergar was killed first by the invisible stalkers. His companion came looking for him minutes later and met the same fate. Both duergar wear dull gray scale armor. Their iron shields, war picks, and javelins lie nearby. They have no treasure. South Arch Gate. This arch is another of Halaster's gates, its sides carved in the form of scantily clad elves (one male and one female) holding fingers to their lips in a gesture of silence. Its rules are as follows:</p><p>• If a silence spell is cast so that the arch is in the spell's area, the gate opens for 1 minute. • Characters must be 15th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12). • A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 6 on level 18, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.</p></div>

As the characters make their way around one side of the loop, they hear footfalls and giggling coming from around the next corner. The sounds stay ahead of them as they circle the loop, but stop if the characters come at them from two directions at once. This effect is the work of a harmless minor illusion cantrip.</p></div>

The characters can forge tenuous alliances with several of the monsters on this level. Award XP for these creatures as if the characters had defeated them in combat. The level is named after a miniature, one-twelfthscale fortress in one of its caverns. This castle serves as the home base of Maddgoth, a serial killer who lures other wizards to his lair to murder them and keep their arcane focuses and spellbooks as trophies. Maddgoth isn't home when the adventurers first arrive, but he might show up later (see "Aftermath," page 108). Most creatures are reduced to one-twelfth their normal size as they approach Maddgoth's castle, enabling them to better fit inside. Either by design or because of some failing, the shrinking magic doesn't affect all creatures, as adventurers who explore the castle will discover.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE 0R I CINAL MADDCOTH ' S CASTLE</head><p>Undermountain: Maddgoth's Castle, written by Steven E. Schend and published in 1996, was the second of three modules in the short-lived "Dungeon Crawl" series of adventures designed for the second edition D&amp;D game. Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage borrows some of the ideas from that earlier adventure while presenting an alternative version of Maddgoth's Castle scaled for fifth edition and this product.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WHAT DWELLS HERE?</head><p>Maddgoth comes and goes from Undermountain with the aid of a horned ring similar to the one worn by Halaster Blackcloak. While he's away, his homunculus watches over his castle. A faerie dragon has also discovered the castle and claimed it as its lair. To reach the castle, adventurers must travel through caverns inhabited by a family of forgetful stone giants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STONE GIANTS</head><p>Ten years ago, Halaster lured a family of stone giants to Undermountain and stripped them of most of their memories. The giants remember who they are and can recall events that happened within the last 8 hours, but everything that occurred before then is lost in a haze and soon forgotten. All their memories of the surface world and its inhabitants faded long ago.</p><p>The stone giants are irritable and self-serving, but not evil. They treat any invasion by humanoids as avermin infestation, nothing more, and attempts to parley with them fall on deaf ears for the most part. They are unaware of the miniature castle in the heart of their domain because it floats in the middle of a great cavern beyond the range of their darkvision.</p><p>The giants are tormented by the faerie dragon that lairs in Maddgoth's castle. It emerges while invisible and uses illus ion spells to close off passages, create false tunnels, and make temporary alterations to the giants' caves. The faerie dragon's mischief has only heightened the stone giants' irritability, and the giants, having never </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OTTO THE FAERIE DRAGON</head><p>A violet faerie dragon named Otto was drawn here by the magic that Halaster wove into these caves. Upon discovering Maddgoth's castle, Otto decided to move in. The faerie dragon was unaffected by the castle's shrinking magic and settled comfortably into its new home. It feeds on bats and other vermin it finds in the surrounding cavern.</p><p>When it's bored, the faerie dragon sneaks out invisibly and uses its spells to make illusory modifications to the stone giants' caves, confounding the giants for its own amusement. The giants have no clue who or what is responsible for this magical mischief.</p><p>The faerie dragon would like to get rid of Maddgoth's homunculus, which has become a troublesome reminder of the castle's true owner. Otto has defeated the homunculus in physical combat more than once, but it keeps coming back. The dragon has concluded that the only way to get rid of the homunculus for good is to forcibly remove it from the castle and trap it elsewhere. If the characters do this for the faerie dragon, Otto allows them to use the castle for rest and relaxation-provided they don't overstay their welcome or loot the joint.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MODIFIED STATISTICS</head><p>While inside the castle, the faerie dragon is 12 feet long relative to its surroundings, because its size is not altered by the castle's shrinking magic. It has a challenge rating of 3 (700 XP) and the following statistical changes:</p><p>• Otto is Large and has 104 (16d10 + 16) hit points.</p><p>• It has a Strength score of 18 (+4), and its bite attack deals 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage on a hit.</p><p>Otto turns invisible and flees if reduced to half its hit points or fewer. It tries to find a hiding place in the castle but abandons the structure if it must. When encountered outside the castle, Otto has the size and statistics of a normal violet faerie dra gon. Whenever Otto's relative size decreases, any hit points beyond its new hit point maximum are lost. Whenever Otto's relative size increases, any damage that Otto has taken remains and is subtracted from its new hit point maximum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MADDG O TH'S HOMUNCULUS</head><p>Maddgoth's homunculus awaits its master's return. The fact that it hasn't perished suggests that Maddgoth is still alive, but their telepathic bond has been severed, indicating that the two are no longer on the same plane of existence. Whether this separation is of Maddgoth's choosing is unknown. The wizard could be sequestered in a demiplane, imprisoned in a mirror of life trapping, or touring the Abyss, for all anyone knows. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MODIFIED STATISTICS</head><p>Inside the castle, the homunculus is 12 feet tall relative to its surroundings, because its size is not altered by the castle's shrinking magic. It has a challenge rating of 2 (450 XP) and the following statistical changes:</p><p>• The homunculus is Large and has 55 (lOdlO) hit points. • It has a Strength score of 15 (+2), and its bite attack deals 9 (2d6 + 2) piercing damage on a hit. • It understands Abyssal, Common, Draconic, and Gnomish, but can't speak.</p><p>If the homunculus is forcibly taken from the castle, its relative size reverts to Tiny, and its statistics become those of a normal homunculus. Whenever the creature's relative size decreases, any hit points beyond its new hit point maximum are lost. Whenever its relative size increases, any damage that it has taken remains and is subtracted from its new hit point maximum.</p></div>

The stone giants don't like the damage that the umber hulks cause and scare them off as best they can.</p><p>Unless otherwise noted, all chambers on this level are rough-hewn (not naturally formed) and have 30-foothigh ceilings. Wider passages are 20 feet tall-ideal for the 18-foot-tall stone giants that dwell here. Narrower tunnels are 5 feet wide and 8 feet tall-too small for the giants to fit inside. All caves and tunnels are unlit, since the giants rely on darkvision to see.</p></div>

Abstract carvings cover the walls, and chiseled bits of stone lie scattered across the floor.</p><p>If the characters catch him by surprise or greet him with hostility, Gravillok retreats to area 13 while shouting out to his family in Giant, "Invasion! Arm yourselves! We're under attack!" Gravillok's deep bellow echoes throughout the level. To the best of his recollection, Gravillok has never seen small folk before. His instinct is to treat them as vermin and smoosh them with his greatclub. If they attempt to parley and he can understand them, he stops attacking long enough to listen to their words, then discounts them, concluding that the interlopers must be responsible for the strange magic bedeviling his family. The characters will have to work hard to change his mind.</p><p>In addition to his greatclub, Gravillok carries a favorite chisel, much too large for Medium or smaller characters to use as an effective tool.</p><p>A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check identifies Gravillok's wall carving as a 30-foot-tall image of Skoraeus Stonebones, the stone giant god.

This cave contains a silt pit like the one in area 4. Hundreds of years ago, before the arrival of the stone giants, an adventurer used a mirror to trick the basilisk into targeting itself with its own petrifying gaze. It has remained a fixture of this cavern ever since. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic emanating from within the basilisk's belly. One must smash open the basilisk to get at the treasure inside. Its belly can be cracked open with a solid weapon hit.</p><p>Treasure. Inside the belly of the basilisk is a gold ring set with moonstones (250 gp) and a wand of conducting. The wand, a common magic item, has 3 charges and doesn't require attunement. The holder of the wand can use an action to expend 1 charge and create orchestral music by waving it around. The music can be heard out to a range of 60 feet and ends when the holder stops waving the wand.</p><p>The wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If the wand's last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a l, a sad tuba sound plays as the wand crumbles to dust and is destroyed.</p></div>

Three dramatic crystal formations explode from the floor, each one roughly 10 feet wide and 15 feet tall. Broken shards of crystal litter the floor around them.</p><p>The stone giants eat the crystals that grow in this chamber. Ten pounds of crystals provide a giant with the equivalent of a nutritious meal. The crystal formations regrow at a steady pace, thanks to Halaster's magic. Most humanoids would not consider them edible.</p></div>

Dozens of humanoid corpses in varying stages of putrefaction, including a few reduced to moldy bones, lie stacked like cordwood against the walls.</p><p>The stone giants have met Halaster several times over the years and carved his visage after many of those occasions. Though the giants' memories of him never last, the faces in this cavern remain.</p><p>The giants have begun using the cavern to store the bodies of creatures they're forced to kill. With the duergar and the drow returning to Undermountain in force and the bullywugs on level 8 becoming more aggressive, such encounters have become commonplace. Again, the giants have no memory of these altercations, and they have no use for the dead creatures' gear.</p><p>The corpses include a drow, two quaggoths, five troglodytes, seven hobgoblins, three duergar, six grimlocks, nine bullywugs, and two humans (former members of an adventuring party).

Otto the faerie dragon shows up to create mischief shortly after the characters arrive.</p><p>If Speleosa detects intruders in her home, she grabs loose rocks from the piles around the room, instructs Obsidia and Rhodos (see area 13a) to do the same, and sets out to destroy the invaders. Attempting to reason with Speleosa while she's hurling rocks is no simple matter, and she isn't receptive to bribes. If one or more of her children are imperiled, Speleosa becomes calm and begins negotiating for their safe release.</p><p>While the characters are dealing with Speleosa, the invisible faerie dragon flies into the cavern, becomes visible momentarily as it casts the hallucinatory terrain spell, and turns invisible again as a bonus action. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 17 or higher glimpse the wee dragon for a second before it turns invisible. On subsequent turns, Otto flies back to Maddgoth's castle. Otto's spell replaces all of areas 10, 12, and 13 with a sylvan forest. The cavern walls remain but are masked by the illusion. Any stone giants in the affected area find themselves in wholly unfamiliar terrain and become panicky. Their inclination is to blame the characters, and dispelling the faerie dragon's magic does little to console them.

Along its perimeter are stone ledges (area 16a) that don't quite encircle the chamber. Any creature knocked off a ledge goes tumbling down the inward-sloping rock walls to the bottom of the cavern (area 16b), which is strewn with rocks, bones, and the bodies of two dead umber hulks.</p><p>At the center of the cavern, floating 10 feet above a smooth, 80-foot-tall mithral spindle that erupts from the floor, is Maddgoth's castle. The stone castle is more than 60 feet away from the ledges, putting it outside the range of some creatures' darkvision. The stone giants have never noticed it for this reason.</p><p>The castle looks small enough to fit in a 20-foot-cube, and it floats at the center of an invisible 40-foot-radius sphere of transmutation magic that shrinks all creatures and objects in its area to one-twelfth their normal size.

He lowers himself to the floor, discovers the mithral spindle, and tries to climb it to see what's at the top. Rebuffed and discouraged by the repulsion field that surrounds the spindle, he starts combing the cavern floor for treasure.</p><p>When an alarm sounds in the caverns around this area, Qurrok climbs up to the ledge closest to the disturbance. If doing that puts him anywhere near his pet cave bears in area 14, he summons them to his s ide with a booming, bear-like roar.</p><p>Qurrok likes physical challenges. He neither shies away from combat nor backs down from a fight unless his mother, Speleosa, commands him to.</p></div>

From its perspective, the creature would seem to fall several hundred feet before suddenly growing twelve times bigger in the final 40 feet before im pact. Because the reducing effect creates more relative distance between the creature and the cavern floor, a fall from anywhere on the castle deals 20d6 bludgeoning damage on im pact. <ref type="table" target="#tab_75">Halaster constructed this castle to serve as a temporary  residence for guests, then abandoned it when he decided  he didn't really want the company.

This alarm warns the faerie dragon and Maddgoth's homunculus that visitors have arrived, though neither creature makes any effort to greet them.</p><p>The room contains the following: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GREEN FLASKS</head><p>Uncorking or breaking a green flask releases a cloud of invisible poison gas called essence of ether. The gas fills a 10-foot-radius sphere and dissipates within seconds. Any creature in the cloud when it forms must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 8 hours. Creatures poisoned in this way fall unconscious, but they wake up if they take damage or if another creature uses an action to shake them awake.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LIVING UNSEEN SERVANTS</head><p>Attacking a servant, s natching its feather duster, or otherwise disturbing the contents of this room triggers combat. On their first turn after rolling initiative, the living unseen servants knock the green flasks off their pedestals, causing the containers to shatter on the floor and release their poison gas (which has no effect on the unseen servants). The servants have no weapons but can a rm themselves with weapons dropped by creatures rendered unconscious by the poison gas. The living unseen servants are bound to this room and can't leave of their own volition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OTTO'S GAME</head><p>Otto the faerie dragon spends much of its time stalking the castle hallways (areas 18, 28, and 38) and takes regular naps in area 43a. While awake, the faerie dragon prefers to remain invisible and likes to play pranks on guests.</p><p>Otto's favorite prank is to sneak up on a guest, engulf it in a cloud of euphoria gas, and sneak away while remain• ing invisible the whole time. Its second favorite prank is to cast mage hand and use the spectral appendage to tap guests on the shoulder. Any time it performs such a prank, the faerie dragon has a 25 percent chance of betraying its location with a giggle or a snicker. The faerie dragon must then relocate itself on its next turn to keep from be• ing caught.</p><p>Casting a spell that requires concentration causes the faerie dragon to become visible-after which it can move, cast a spell that doesn't requ ire concentration (such as color spray or hallucinatory terrain), and use its bonus ac• tion to turn invisible again. Otto is careful about casting spells that require concentration, because it can't concentrate on the spell and stay invisible at the same time. It norma lly casts mirror image before casting a spell that requires concentration, trusting that its images wil l protect it whi le it maintains concentration on the spell. If Otto succeeds in incapacitating a guest, it tries to remove the guest's wea pons and gear, then spends the next hour hiding these items throughout the castle.</p><p>Otto reserves its polymorph spell for a truly dangerous adversary, turning that enemy into a frog before making a hasty escape.</p><p>If the characters get rid of Maddgoth's homunculus, the faerie dragon takes a shine to them and offers to pay them 50 gp for each trinket they del iver to it.

Inscribed on the wall inside the arch is a riddle in Common.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">ARCH GATE TO LEVEL 9</formula><p>The arch is one of Ha laster's magic gates (see "Gates," page 12). Inscribed on its wall is the following riddle in Common: "What appears once in an hour, twice in a blue moon, and never in sunshine?" The answer is "The letter O." The rules of this gate are as follows:</p><p>• If the riddle is answered aloud and correctly by someone within 30 feet of the arch, the gate opens for 1 minute. • Characters must be 10th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12). • A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 42 on level 9, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there. Pulling the correct lever in area 37 unlocks all the doors leading to the courtyard. A knock spell or similar magic can also unlock a door. Each time such a spell is cast in the courtyard, a blade of force like that created by the Mordenkainen's sword spell materializes next to the statue. Each sword acts on initiative count 17. On its turn, the sword flies up to 20 feet toward the nearest creature and makes a melee spell attack against it (+8 to hit), dealing 3d10 force damage on a hit. A sword lasts for 1 minute or until successfully dispelled (DC 17), and it can pursue creatures beyond the courtyard's confines.</p></div>

A detect magic spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the ship.</p><p>An identify spell or similar magic cast on the model reveals that it's an actual longship magically reduced to one-twelfth its normal size. The spell also reveals that the only way to restore the ship to its actual size (54 feet long by 15 feet wide) is to touch the ship while speaking the proper command phrase: "Our voyage is at hand!" Once the ship enlarges to normal size, it becomes an ordinary longship (worth 10,000 gp intact) and cannot be shrunk back down. If it is restored to full size in a space too small to contain it, such as this chamber, the ship splinters apart and is destroyed.

When a creature casts a spell in this room or disturbs the figure in the bed, the six wands depicted in the framed portraits magically spring from their paintings, gaining the statistics of flying swords, and remain detached from the paintings thereafter. Replace the wands' Longsword action option with the following:</p><p>Magic Missile. The wand shoots a dart of magical force at one creature that it can detect within 60 feet of it. The target takes 3 (1 d4 + 1) force damage as the dart hits it unerringly. </p></div>

Standing north of the door is what appears to be a mind flayer.</p><p>Most of the apparel on display was taken from wizards whom Maddgoth killed. Consequently, they come in all sizes and fashions. Many of these items have obvious burn marks, tears, bloodstains, and other defects suggesting how their previous owners met their ends.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MIND FLAYER COSTUME</head><p>Closer inspection reveals that the mind flayer is a featureless wooden mannequin dressed in a convincing mind flayer costume, complete with black robe, cowl, and rubber mask. A Medium character who wears the costume can make Charisma (Deception) checks to impersonate a mind flayer. Such checks are made with advantage if the costume is viewed in poor lighting or from more than 15 feet away. A character who wears the mask has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. A character who wears the robe and cowl has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. The robe and cowl can't be worn over heavy armor.</p><p>Maddgoth gathers intelligence on wizards across Faerfin, prepares dossiers on several "promising" ones, and stores these records here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>36A. GATHERED INTELLIGENCE</head><p>This room contains rows of wooden cabinets stuffed with disorganized files chronicling the magical exploits of thousands of wizards dating back hundreds of years. Half of the dossiers are so old that they've crumbled to dust. Scrawled on most of the remaining ones is the word "DECEASED" in Maddgoth's hand, while a handful of dossiers bear the word "LICH" instead.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>36B. SECURE RECORDS</head><p>The door to this room is locked and trapped with a glyph of warding spell. Maddgoth took the key with him, and opening the door by any means other than using the proper key triggers the spell. Picking the lock requires thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.</p><p>An examination of the door accompanied by a successful DC 19 Intelligence (Investigation) check detects the nearly invisible glyph, which is scratched into one </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="37.">CONSOLE</head><p>The door frame has a platinum coin wedged into it (see area 19). Bolted to the floor in the middle of the room is an iron console that resembles a pedestal with a slanted top. Protruding from the console are three brass levers arranged side by side, with the outer levers in the up position a nd the middle lever in the down position. To the right of the levers are five brass buttons situated at the points of a gold pentagram. An inscription appears next to each lever and each button. A creature can use an action to adjust up to three levers and buttons, in any combination. The console serves several functions:</p><p>Leftmost Lever. The inscription under this lever reads "COURTYARD." Lowering the lever unlocks the fou r doors that lead into area 23. Raising the lever locks them again. Middle Lever. The inscription under this lever reads "LIGHT." Raising the lever turns on the castle's interior lights. Lowering the lever turns them off again. (While the interior lights are on, creatures in the surrounding cavern can see the castle.) Rightmost Lever. The inscription under this lever reads "HEAT." Lowering the lever s huts off the heat, reducing the interior temperature by 10 degrees each hour until it drops to 30 degrees Fahre nheit (the temperature of the surrounding cavern). Raising the lever causes the temperature to rise 10 degrees each hour until it reaches 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Button 1. The inscription next to this button reads "MUSIC." Pushing the button fills the castle with ambient orchestral music occasionally punctuated with a s inging chorus. Pressing the button again ends the music. Button 2. The inscription next to this button reads "ROOF." Pushing the button teleports all creatures in the room to the castle rooftop (area 43), along with whatever items they're wearing a nd carrying. Button 3. The inscription under this button reads "FOG." Pushing the button fills the castle hallways (areas 18, 28, and 38) and the stairways connecting them with fog, making these areas heavily obscured. The fog lasts for 1 hour or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. Button 4. The inscription next to this button reads "LOCKDOWN." Pushing the button causes every door in the castle (including the rooftop trapdoor) to lock, as if sealed by an arcane lock spell. This effect lasts for 1 hour. While locked in this way, the interior doorsmost of which are as much iron as glass-also become electrified. Such a door deals 5 (ldlO) lightning damage to any creature that touches it. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="38.">GLITTERING HALL</head><p>The halls on this level join to form a circuit, with crystal-barred windows looking down on the central courtyard (area 23).</p><p>The floor is made of tiny bits of colored glass and crushed gems, polished to a lustrous sheen. Four living unseen servants (see appendix A), each carrying a mop and a bucket of soapy water, stand outside the doors to areas 39 through 42, ready to clean up any spills in the hall. The servants defend themselves with their mops (treat as clubs) if attacked but are otherwise harmless.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S TAIRS T O THE ROO F</head><p>The northernmost staircase climbs 20 feet before ending at an 8 -foot-square stone trapdoor. When a creature starts to climb the stairs, the trapdoor opens outward, allowing access to the roof (area 47). The trapdoor closes on its own 1 minute later.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="39.">SOUTHWEST CHAMBER</head><p>The walls, floor, and ceiling of this room are scorched. S trewn about are blackened pieces of furn iture, shards of smoky glass, and charred splinters of wood and bone.</p><p>A character who examines the room thoroughly and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check concludes that four separate fiery eruptions caused the destruction. A successful DC 19 Intelligence {Arcana) check reveals that the damage was likely the result of a meteor swarm spell cast in the room.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="40.">NORTHWEST CHAMBE R</head><p>The door frame has a copper coin wedged into it (see area 19), and the door has a sta ined glass wolf's head worked into its design. The room is dusty a nd empty but for a few cobwebs in the corners .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="41.">NORTH EAST CHA MBER</head><p>The door frame has a silver coin wedged into it (see area 19). The room contains the following:</p><p>Mirror. Embedded in the middle of the south wall is a rectangular mirror in a stone fra me.  Halaster melded a roper and a mimic to create this creature with the statis tics of a roper a nd the ability to shape itself into objects like a mimic. While immobile in object form, it is indistinguishable from a normal object. Only when the roper reverts to its true form do its monstrous features become apparent. The roper has the following additional trait:</p><p>Shapechanger. The roper can use its action to polymorph into a stone object or back to its t rue form. Its statistics are th e same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</p><p>The roper answers to the name Miguel. It has instructions to attack any creature that enters the room through the mirror gate. It a lso attacks any creature that threatens to do it harm. Halaster feeds the roper regularly so that it doesn't have to attack out of hunger. Neither Otto the faerie dragon nor Maddgoth's homunculus is aware that the statue is really a creature in disguise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TREASURE</head><p>If the characters kill and cuts open the roper, they find five misshapen diamonds (100 gp each) in its gizzard.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="42.">SOUTHEAST CHAMBER</head><p>The door to this room is missing its stained glass window panes. Tiny shard of glass stuck in the iron frame suggest that the glass was smashed. (Maddgoth's unseen servants cleaned up the mess.) The room beyond is dusty and empty but for a few cobwebs in the corners.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="43.">OTTO'S DEN</head><p>Maddgoth crafted and tested magic items here. The area contains several lingering magical effects that prompted the faerie dragon to turn these chambers into its private den. Whenever Otto leaves to torment the stone giants or wander the castle, Maddgoth's homunculus sneaks in here to trash the place.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>43A. "HOMUNCULI UNWELCOME"</head><p>The characters hear crashing sounds as they approach thjs room. Hanging on the handle of each door to this room is a crude wood-and-rope sign bearing the chalk words "HOMUNCULI UNWELCOME" in Draconic. The western door is closed and has a gold coin wedged in its frame (see area 19). Maddgoth's homunculus knows it can't be killed and attacks the characters unless they withdraw immediately. If it is destroyed, it melts away and re-forms in area 25a.</p><p>Otto's spoils include candles and candle snuffers, potted mushrooms, mortars and pestles, lamps, belts, pentacle pendants, recipe books, sticks of colored chalk, kettles, cauldrons, spoons, stuffed animals, spools of wire, glass beads, wigs, walking sticks, bars of soap, balls of yarn, cracked mirrors and prisms, quills, smoking pipes, empty scroll tubes, and torn sheaves of parchment. Though some of the collection's pieces might be useful and many are colorful or whimsical in design, nothing here holds any special value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>43B. OTTO'S SECRET STASH</head><p>Otto's most prized possessions fill this cluttered space. These treasures are spread across tables that have been stacked atop one another, forming makeshift shelves that scrape the 20-foot-high ceiling and threaten to topple at any moment. Any character who tries to get at a hard-to-reach item has a 50 percent chance of setting into motion a Rube Goldberg-esque cascade of tables and baubles. When everything comes tumbling down, every creature in the room must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p>Treasure. The items gathered here include dozens of porcelain and ceramic dragon statuettes, old storybooks, worthless but shiny costume jewelry, a pair of jade bookends carved to resemble yuan-ti abominations (250 gp for the pair), two random trinkets (roll twice on the Trinkets table in chapter 5 of the <ref type="bibr">Player's Handbook)</ref>, and coffers stuffed with a total of 30 pp, 150 gp, 300 ep, 1,500 sp, and 5,000 cp. Perched atop a high table is a potion of fire breath in a small crystal flask that breaks if the tables fall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="44.">WIZARD'S ARMORY</head><p>This room is locked, its key lost. Otto punched a hole through one of the door's glass panes to get a look inside but didn't see anything of interest. Characters who peer inside see the following:</p><p>Bats. Two ordinary bats flap around the room. Each bat transforms into a nycaloth if it is reduced to 0 hit points or if the door to the room is opened. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="45">. ALCH EMIST'S LABORATORY</head><p>Otto removed anything it considered valuable from this chamber but periodically returns to see if it missed anything. If the faerie dragon hasn't been encountered and defeated elsewhere, there is a 25 percent chance that it's here when the characters arrive, in which case the door to the room is open. If Otto is not present, the door is closed and has a silver coin lodged in its frame (see area 19). The room's features are as follows: <ref type="table" target="#tab_75">Tables. Tables stand haphazardly about the room, their</ref> s urfaces cluttered with alchemical equipment. Cabinets. Corner cabinets are brimming with skuJ!s, jars of powdered substances, and leather-bound journals filled with Maddgoth's mad scribblings. Refuse. The floor is strewn with bits of broken glass, scraps of parchment, and other refuse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ThEASURE</head><p>The room contains three full sets of alchemist's supplies, a ll of which can fit in one backpack. A potion of invisibility in a stoppered glass vial has rolled underneath the northwest corner cabinet and is lodged in the back corner. A detect magic spell reveals its presence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="46">. MADDGOTH 'S THRON E</head><p>The door frame has an electrum coin wedged into it (see area 19).</p><p>A tall throne made of iron and stained glass stands in the southern alcove, facing the door. The throne's clawed armrests and feet give it a monstrous appearance, but there's nothing dangerous about it. Laid before the throne is a IS-foot-diameter circular rug with a pattern resembling a large gaping mouth. The rug, too, is harmless.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="47.">ROOF AN D BATTLE M ENTS</head><p>The roof offers little in the way of a view, since the surrounding cavern is all but lost in darkness. The echoes that a single shout can create are astonishing, though. Four-foot-high crenellated battlements enclose the roof. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AFTERMATH</head><p>What happens in the miniature castle has little impact on the stone giants, and vice versa. Killing all the giants saddens Otto the faerie dragon, but its goals don't change. If the characters help the giants by dealing with the faerie dragon, all is forgotten in a few hours when the giants' memories fade away.</p><p>If the slaad in area 33 succeeds in slaying or driving off the characters, it makes its home in the castle, hoping that Maddgoth will one day return with the slaad's control gem. In a struggle between the faerie dragon and the slaad for control of the castle, the slaad can win either by killing Otto or forcing the dragon into hiding.</p><p>Characters who leave the level and later return discover that the giants don't recognize them or remember having met them previously. If one or more giants were killed, the surviving ones retain no memory of how their fallen kin died. If all the giants die, Halaster might freeze the caverns and fill them with a tribe of yetis led by a mated pair of abominable yetis, or provide the space to a clan of degenerate fomorians.</p><p>After the characters depart, Maddgoth might return to check on things. He's either a neutral evil archmage who has exceeded his natural life span with potions of longevity, or he's a lich. Choose whichever form you prefer. In either case, Maddgoth tries to put his house in order, which could take weeks if the characters made a mess of things. Maddgoth might be accompanied by a mage he has invited to stay with him on some false pretense. In truth, Maddgoth plans to torture and murder his house guest, as he has done with so many others.</p><p>Maddgoth wears a horned ring (a very rare magic item) that allows a wearer attuned to it to ignore Undermountain's magical restrictions (see "Alterations to Magic," page 10). He also carries the control gem for the slaad in area 33. If the party didn't claim his helm (see area 25b), he dons it for the duration of his stay in the castle. If the nycaloths are still around (see area 44), Maddgoth retains their services as bodyguards. If the characters prove too great a challenge for him, Maddgoth teleports away and returns the next day with eight mezzoloths to help him clean house.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LITHERSWAMP IS OESICNED FOR FOUR IOTH-</head><p>level characters, and characters who defeat the monsters on this level should gain enough XP to reach halfway to 11th level. This level consis ts of muck-filled caverns and decaying temples dedicated to evil deities of the yuan-ti. The serpent folk lived here until they were defeated by nagas known as the Ssethian Scourges. Afterward, Halaster replaced the yuan-ti with a bullywug tribe governed by a cruel death slaad overlord.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WHAT DWELLS HERE?</head><p>Adventurers might find themselves caught up in the war of Slitherswamp by encounte ring the thralls of the Ssethian Scourges, the Blacktongue bullywug tribe, the meddling ghost of a yuan-ti priest (see area 9), or watchful agents of the Dweomercore mages of level 9.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE SSETHIAN SCOURGES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>~~~~~~~~~</head><p>The Ssethian Scourges were three spirit nagas that fought the yuan-ti of the Slitherswamp, eventually claiming victory. Only two spirit nagas remain, Excrutha and Serakath, along with their thralls and the remnants of the third spirit naga, Hexacali, who was destroyed and transformed into a bone naga by the yuan-ti.</p><p>The spirit nagas maintain a stable of thralls and use a rod of rulership to insure their obedience. Every day at dawn, the nagas gather their thralls in area 15a and target them again with the recharged rod, and each naga has the special ability to increase the duration of the charm effect to 12 hours. Humanoid thralls that resist the rod's magic often choose to maintain the appearance of being charmed for the sake of their own survival, because the nagas kill or chain up those they can't magically enslave.</p><p>Shortly after the Ssethian Scourges defeated their yuan-ti foes, a tribe of bullywugs led by a death slaad appeared in the S litherswamp. Frustrated by this new obstacle to their dominance of the level, the nagas now seek allies to slay the bullywugs and their leader. The nagas know the locations of all the magic gates on this level, as well as how to activate them. They share that information with creatures that willingly serve them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE BLACKTONGUES ~~~~~~~~~</head><p>A year ago, Halaster used his magic to transport the Blacktongue tribe of bullywugs, along with its small army of giant frogs and giant toads, from a remote marshland to this level of Undermountain. He seeded them into those parts of S litherswamp once controlled by the yuan-ti. The bullywugs were quick to capture and domesticate four carrion crawlers and a hydra.</p><p>Halaster also summoned a death slaad named Kuketh to Slitherswamp. The Mad Mage keeps the slaad's control gem in his sanctua ry on level 9 and forces Kuketh to serve as the bullywugs' king. The Blacktongues live in fear of their new king, whom they call Yurk Y'blorkflug ("lord of fetid obliteration" in their language). The slaad hates being under Halaster's control and takes out its frustration on its s ubjects. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>KARSTIS O F D WEOMERCORE</head><p>The mages of Dweomercore (level 9) have sent one of their own, a human named Karstis, to monitor this level. He hides in areas and 8 with his minions. Karstis is an ally of those looking to thin out any of the factions in Slitherswamp, but a foe to anyone who tries to gain access to Dweomercore. This entire level is wet and humid. Ordinary frogs, toads, and insects thrive here.</p></div>

The walls and floor of the tunnel drip with moisture from the humidity, and buzzing insects a re everywhere. Rope La dder. The crumbling remains of a ramp lie below the precipice. A slimy rope ladder has been anchored with spikes to its western edge.</p><p>The rope ladder has been smeared with carrion crawler mucus. Any creature climbing down the ladder must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. A creature poisoned in this way is a lso paralyzed and fa lls from the rope ladder into the muck of area 2 below, taking 3 (ld6) bludgeoning damage. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mucus's effect on itself on a success.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">BULLYWUG SENTRIES</head><p>Ceiling. This swampy cavern has an uneven 30-foothigh ceiling. Fireflies. Harmless fireflies flit over strange fungal plants that sprout from the swamp, filling the cavern with eerie dim light. Bullywugs. Three bullywugs use their Swamp Camouflage feature to hide in the swampy tunnel leading to area 19.</p><p>The bullywugs watch the tunnel that leads to level 7. When they spot the characters, three of them try to sneak away to areas 19a and 20, to warn the rest of the tribe. The others wait to see where the intruders go. The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12). • A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 34b on level 6, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DANGEROUS SHRUBBERY -------</head><p>A 20-foot-high dry ledge (area 4a) overlooks a 30-foothigh cavern filled with vegetation and ankle-deep mud (area 4b). This area's features are as follows:</p><p>Vegetation. Luminescent, fern-like plants sprouting from the mud fill this area with dim light. Severed Limb. Part of the ledge wall is stained with blood. Directly below the stain, a severed leg wearing a sturdy boot sticks up out of the mud.</p></div>

Atop the ledge, above the bloodstain but not visible from the tunnel floor, the body of a duergar sprawls near a campsite. The corpse is that ofThubid Duskaxe, a duergar adventurer on a rescue mission. He lost a leg when he fought the shambling mounds and subsequently bled to death.</p><p>Treasure. The corpse wears a leather satchel that contains 224 gp, an ornate stone carving of an owl (SO gp), and a journal written in Dwarvish. The journal contains a map showing areas 1 through 6, as well as notes of "frog people to the northeast" and "serpents with foul magic to the southeast." The journal describes Thubid's plan to find allies to help him rescue his cousin, Agorra, who was "bewitched by the serpents."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4B. SH A MBLING MOUNDS</head><p>Any character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check is not surprised when three shambling mounds attack. The shambling mounds chase creatures through the mud but ignore creatures atop the ledge. Ruins and Statue. Amid the ruins of a dome built of black stone is a statue of a snake with closed eyes swallowing its own tail. Apparition. The ghostly image of an adventurer moves through the area, looking lost.</p><p>The ghostly image of a male human warrior in plate armor wanders around the statue as though searching for something he has lost. The image cannot be harmed and does not acknowledge the characters. If a character dies on this level, the image changes to appear as that character, even if the character is later raised from the dead. A dispel magic spell that targets the image causes it to disappear for 1 hour.</p><p>A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check suggests that the statue is a representation of Dendar the Night Serpent, the yuan-ti god of nightmares. Any character who touches the statue is cursed. Until the curse is ended with a remove curse spell or similar magic, the character is beset by nightmares and gains no benefit from a long rest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">WARDED CAVERN</head><p>Aglyph of warding spell has been cast on the floor at the center of the 10-foot-high cavern. The glyph triggers a cloudkill spell (save DC 15) when any creature other than Karstis passes the midpoint of the cavern. The spell's cloud lasts for 10 minutes.</p></div>

The caves' inhabitants include a mage named Karstis.</p><p>If death or capture seems likely, Karstis grabs his spellbook in area 8b and flees to level 9 after instructing his bodyguards to cover his escape. Thereafter, Karstis can be encountered in area 8c on level 9.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>8A. GUARDS</head><p>Golem. A flesh golem stands watch in the middle of this 10-foot-high cave, facing the entrance. Wights. Two wights are on guard at the south end of the cave (outside area 8b). Crates. Three open crates are stored in the westernmost alcove. They contain sheets of parchment, small jars of ink, quills, 10 days of edible rations, and five 2-gallon casks of clean water.</p><p>If the glyph in area 7 triggers, the flesh golem and the wights can't be surprised.

The interior walls are covered in carvings of snakes, fanged maws, and open ophidian eyes. Black St atue. The northwest section of the temple contains a black stone statue of a masked, hooded male humanoid dressed in leather armor and clutching a dripping dagger in each hand. Harmless centipedes crawl all over the statue. Green Statu e. The middle chamber contains a statue carved of green stone, depicting a 15-foot-tall winged snake with its fangs bared. Harmless snakes slither around the statue's base. Ghost. Wandering through the ruin is a spectral woman wearing a soiled black gown and a featureless white mask (actually the ghost of a slain yuan-ti priest).</p><p>A yuan-ti pureblood priest named Yoastal was slain by the Ssethian Scourges and remains bound to the temple. Because she cannot leave, she tries to trick others into completing her unfinished business, knowing that she cannot rest until the Ssethian Scourges are dead.</p><p>Yoastal can be both friend and foe to an adventuring party. The ghost claims to have once been a cleric of Mask, cursed to remain in Slitherswamp until the nagas are destroyed. She provides characters with the layout of the level in exchange for promises to free her. But her information is always slanted toward leading the characters into situations that might further escalate the war between the Ssethian Scourges and the Blacktongues.</p><p>If Yoastal is destroyed while any of the nagas live, she re-forms in this ruined building in ld4 days.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BLACK STATUE</head><p>Water trickling down from the ceiling falls onto this statue and drips off its daggers like poison. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check recognizes the statue as a representation of the yuan-ti god Sseth.</p><p>A character who searches through the mud around the statue and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discovers a rotting sack and also digs up a hostile s warm of insects (centipedes).</p><p>Treasure. The sack contains 550 gp.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GREEN STATUE</head><p>A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check recognizes this statue as another representation of Sseth. This cavern is flooded to a depth of 4 feet. The water glows green around an emerald that lies on the floor in the middle of the cavern. This gemstone has been blessed by Sseth, such that it turns the water around it to poison. Any creature that starts its turn in the water must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Water that leaves the cavern is no longer poisonous, and the water in the cavern ceases to be poisonous once the emerald is removed from it. Treasure. The flawed emerald loses its magic if taken from the area and is worth 250 gp.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>lOB. HISSING STONE</head><p>In the middle of this cavern, a large stone rises above the 3-foot-deep water and magically emits a soft hissing sound. The natural pattern of the stone vaguely resembles a swarm of snakes. A character who touches the stone hears a sibilant whisper asking that individual to ask a question aloud.

If this button is pressed, a secret compartment on the north side of the altar opens. Inside this compartment is a slender red taper (see "Treasure" below). Kuketh and the bullywugs are unaware of the altar's hidden compar tment and the treasure within.</p><p>Treasure. The red taper is a candle of invocation dedicated to Sseth, the neutra l evil yuan-ti god. If the candle is removed from the altar by a creature that is not a yuan-ti, green mist billows up through cracks in the floor and coalesces into two yuan-ti abomina tions. These temple guardians attack any creature that is not a yuan-ti. When reduced to 0 hit points, they revert to clouds of green mist and disappear without a trace.</p><p>If the yuan-ti abominations are not killed, they rid the temple of enemies and turn it into their lair.

The slaad communicates with strangers using telepathy and is willing to negotiate with characters who claim to be enemies of the Ssethian Scourges.

It' s only a matter of time, however, before the Ssethian Scourges seize him, make him one of their thralls, and take control of the bullywug tribe. If all the Blacktongue bullywugs are defeated, the temple becomes a safe place for the characters to rest (assuming the yuan-ti abominations in area 19d haven't taken over the place).</p><p>Killing the Ssethian Scourges frees Yoastal from her curse and allows the Blacktongues to overrun the nagas' caves. Karstis and the mages of Dweomercore might be there already, though, wanting to hold those caverns.

Cephalossk tries to convince the characters to distract and kill Dumara (Spite's oni bodyguard) while it devours Spite's brain. In exchange for their help, Cephalossk promises to tell them "three secrets that every Undermountain explorer should know." Once it has fed on Spite's brain, Cephalossk makes good on its promise and telepathically shares the following information with the characters:</p><p>• A mind flayer colony has taken over a level of Undermountain known as Seadeeps. (Cephalossk knows this because it has been in telepathic contact with the ulitharid on level 17.) • Githyanki have invaded Undermountain and are trying to exterminate the mind flayer colony in Seadeeps. • Halaster has commandeered a vessel that can travel between worlds through space and hidden it somewhere in Undermountain (see level 19).</p><p>If the characters refuse to assist Cephalossk, the mind flayer attacks them.</p></div>

In the middle of the room, standing atop a 1-foot-high cylindrical block of stone, is a statue of a scowling medusa with a longbow and an empty quiver. The statue gazes north. When a creature sets off the trap in area 2, a poisoned arrow materializes in the medusa's grasp as the statue animates. It immediately draws back on the bow and shoots the arrow at the creature that triggered the trap (+6 to hit), dealing 6 (ld8 + 2) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage on a hit.</p><p>The medusa statue is a Medium object with AC 15, 50 hit points, and immunity to all damage except force damage. It weighs 1,200 pounds. A creature can use an action to try to knock the statue off its base, doing so with a successful DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check. If it is toppled, the statue does not animate until returned to its former position. (If Worm riddle learns about the toppled statue, she and her Resh golems set it right before seeking to punish those responsible.)</p></div>

A pull-rope on one s ide of the curtain allows it to be drawn back. Behind the curtain hangs a large abstract painting that depicts Halaster surrounded by fields of bloody mouths and people feasting on each other. Worked into the background are various other bizarre figures from beyond the Material Plane. Halaster's face is chillingly calm despite the violent chaos around him, and his piercing gaze seems to follow anyone who views the portrait. Spite is holding a wand with a fight cantrip cast on the end of it and reading a bone-dry biography of Ahghairon, the archwizard who founded Waterdeep. If the characters are being led through Dweomercore by the headmaster, Spite smiles at them as they pass by. Once they're gone, he and the oni cast invisibility on themselves and follow the characters, curious to learn their intentions in Dweomercore. Spite and Dumara confront the characters as soon as they can do so privately (see "Evil Students," page 117).</p><p>The notebooks stored here are small and thin enough that they can be curled up and stuffed in pneumatic tube canisters. The books cover subjects of interest to wizards, including spell component harvesting, ruminations on the Weave, biographies of famous wizards and liches, tips for creating realistic illusions, and essays written by previous students on a wide range of arcane topics. Any book in this collection that is removed from Dweomercore magically disappears and reappears back on its proper shelf.</p></div>

Hanging on the wall behind the curtain are fifteen paintings, each one 5 feet long and 3 feet tall, arranged in three rows of five.</p><p>Each painting depicts a graduating class of dour-faced Dweomercore wizards. Most of the older paintings show the students as skeletons-signifying which graduating students have died. Careful examination reveals that Halaster appears in every class picture except the center portrait in the middle row.

The footlocker holds nine similar jars, all empty. Cephalossk hungers for fresh brains but subsists on preserved ones when no other food source is available. Treasure. Cephalossk keeps its spellbook in a desk drawer. The book is made of thin copper plates held together with mithral wire. Each page bears embossed stanzas of braille-like writing called Qualith, which the mind flayer reads with its tentacles. A non-illithid must use a comprehend languages spell or similar magic to comprehend the writing. The book contains all the spells Cephalossk has prepared (see the sidebar in the "Mind Flayer" entry in the Monster Manual). After being alerted to the arrival of visitors by his spider familiar, Elan spends 3 rounds traveling from area 13a to his dormitory. Elan greets strangers in a friendly manner (see "Elan Tanor'thal," page 118).</p><p>The shrine almost resembles a lantern, designed to be easily transportable. Contained inside is a black basalt statuette of Lolth in her drow form, strung with cobwebs. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of enchantment magic around the statuette. Any creature that touches the statuette must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or suffer a random form of short-term madness, determined by rolling on the Short-Term Madness table in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. A creature that successfully saves against the madness effect can safely hold the statuette.</p><p>Treasure.

Nylas hides his spellbook inside the ogre zombie's rotting torso. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher and come within 5 feet of the zombie can see the spell book wedged between its ribs. A character can use an action to try to snatch the spellbook while the zombie is animate with a s uccessful DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. No check is needed to remove the book if the zombie is incapacitated or destroyed.

At one point, drow sought to expand this level of the dungeon and set slaves to the task of hewing new passageways. The project was abandoned when Halaster and his apprentices pushed the drow out.</p></div>

SLAMMING DOORS</head><p>The first time the characters reach the midpoint of this hall, they hear a double door slam shut, either to the northeast (30 percent chance) or the southwest (70 percent chance).

A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the glyphs around each door prevent devils from passing through the doorway. Scratching away any of the glyphs breaks the magic on that door, enabling devils to pass through it normally. The devils perform their duties in a half-hearted manner, usually undercooking or overcooking the food. Despite their displeasure, they keep the kitchen clean and tidy, as befits their orderly nature. The living unseen servants have no function other than to deliver meals.</p><p>The stove is powered by magic from the Elemental Plane of Fire and puts out a lot of heat.

It has no substance, and creatures and objects can pass right through it. The illusory wall can be removed with a successful dispel magic spell (DC 14). None of the books stored here are valuable, and many are so old that they fall apart if opened.

Rather than follow the prescribed method, he devised his own technique and botched the ritual spells. Consequently, his phylactery was shattered, and his body and mind have slowly crumbled away. The floating skull and hanging skeletal arms are all that remain of him; they move like they're attached to an invisible body.</p><p>Nester educates Dweomercore's pupils in the art of necromancy, but his knowledge has become fragmented, and his mind tends to wander. He assumes the adventurers are students sent to learn the darkest of the magical arts and begins telepathically lecturing them about zombies, often repeating himself. He attacks anyone who tries to leave the lecture before its conclusion.</p><p>Nester is an archmage, with these changes:</p><p>• Nester is undead and chaotic evil.</p><p>• He understands Auran, Common, Draconic, Dwarvish, Giant, and Terran, but can't speak. (He uses Rary's telepathic bond to communicate.) • He has the animate dead spell prepared instead of fly, the blight spell prepared instead of banishment, and the Rary's telepathic bond spell prepared instead of scrying.

Close examination reveals two or more pinpricks of silver light deep inside the sphere. A professor orb is sentient and has the personality of a scholar. Its alignment is determined by rolling on the alignment table in the "Sentient Magic Items" section in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. Regardless of its disposition, the orb has an Intelligence of 18, and Wisdom and Charis ma scores determined by rolling 3d6 for each ability. The orb speaks, reads, and understands four languages, and can see and hear normally out to a range of 60 feet. Unlike most sentient items, the orb has no will of its own and can't initiate a conflict with the creature in possession of it.</p><p>A professor orb has extensive knowledge of four narrow academic subjects. When making an Intelligence check to recall lore from any of its areas of expertise, the orb has a +9 bonus to its roll (including its Intelligence modifier).</p><p>In addition to the knowledge it possesses, a professor orb can cast the mage hand cantrip at will.

The ghostly skull is neither a creature nor an object, but a magical force. It has darkvision and truesight out to a range of 60 feet, but it can't perceive any creature warded by a nondetection spell or s imilar magic. The skull can't move or be moved from its space, and it can't be damaged. Because it's without substance, other crea• tures can occupy its space.

When this happens, all creatures in the vicinity must roll initiative, including the stone golem. The skull acts on initiative count 30 and again on initiative count 15. On each of the skull's turns, all creatures in the room except the stone golem are telekinetically thrust straight up into the air, then cast down hard onto the floor. Each target takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and ends the turn prone in its space. (Although the telekinesis effect is magical, the damage it deals is not.) Only when there are no more creatures left to toss about does the ghostly skull cease its assault.</p><p>When the ghostly skull screams, the golem uses its first turn in combat to block the south exit, pushing the door closed and shoving smaller creatures out of the way automatically. By occupying the space north of the door, the golem prevents the door from being opened.

Behind the desk, attached to a thin iron chain and draped over one corner of a tall black crystal chair, is a fist•sized, gleaming black gemstone-the control gem for the death slaad on level 8 (a legend lore spell or s imilar magic confirms as much). The cells contain no furnishings other than waste buckets. The middle cell on the east side of the hall holds three goblins abducted from Azrok's Hold (level 3, area 21) by Wormriddle. Their names are Evilfinger, Pulk, and Tobble. If they are rescued, the goblins wait until their rescuers fall asleep, then rob them and escape. Until then, they follow the party and contribute as little as possible.</p></div>

The bone devil agreed. After Yarek released the devil, it immediately murdered him. To fulfill its agreement with the mage, the devil must now kill Skrianna. Wards placed on these chambers prevent the devil from leaving, however, and the greater wards placed on Undermountain by Halaster prevent it from getting away by plane shifting.</p><p>Before he died, Yarek used a sending spell to warn the headmaster about the escaped devil. If the arcanaloth persuades the characters to destroy the devil in exchange for safe passage through Dweomercore, it waits patiently for them in area 46b while they confront the fiend in these chambers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>47A. ALAS, POOR YAREK</head><p>Characters who examine the doors to this room (each marked with an asterisk on map 9) notice thin silver Yarek dragged himself across the floor before he finally expired. The characters can follow Yarek's bloody trail through the illusory wall into area 47b, where the devil mortally wounded him. A character who examines the corpse and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check can ascertain that the mage was stabbed several times by a piercing weapon (the devil's hooked polearm) and has a deep, poisoned wound in his chest (caused by the bone devil's stinger). A search of the body yields nothing of value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>47B. DEALING WITH THE BONE DEVIL</head><p>Devil. Beyond the illusory wall waits a bone devil armed with a hooked polearm (see the "Variant: Bone Devil Polearm" sidebar in the "Devils" entry in the Monster Manual). Statue. A raised stone alcove contains a chipped and worn statue of a female drow riding a giant lizard. The tip of the lizard's tail has broken off and is missing. (The statue is inanimate and nonmagical.)</p><p>The bone devil is reluctant to take on a well-armed band of adventurers, since the outcome is likely to conflict with its goals of survival and escape. If the characters are willing to free it from the confines of these rooms by scratching away the silver glyphs that ward the exits, the devil pursues a mutually beneficial arrangement while exploiting a badly worded agreement to its advantage. Once it escapes, it tries to hunt down and kill Skrianna Shadowdusk, thus fulfilling a promise made to its late summoner. If the characters slay the devil, it transforms into a pool of s tinking ichor, leaving its hooked polearm behind.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>47C. DWEOMERCORE'S VAULT</head><p>Stacked against the south wall are seven iron chests that hold Dweomercore's operating funds (used to pay guest instructors, purchase school supplies, and so forth).

A stone arch embedded in the middle of the southeast wall has the image of an open book carved into its keystone. Secret Door. A secret door opens into a dusty tunnel leading east.</p><p>The arch is one of Ha laster's gates (see "Gates," page 12). Its rules are as follows:</p><p>• Holding an open book while standing within 5 feet of the arch causes the gate to open for 1 minute. The book turns to dust as the gate opens, even if it is a spell book. • Characters must be 13th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12) . • A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 25 on level 14, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AFTERMATH</head><p>Characters who become embroiled in academy politics can form tenuous truces with certain students while making enemies of others. The loss of one or more students has little effect on the day-to-day affairs of Dweomercore, since the faculty has no emotional attachment to the pupils. Within a tenday, the headmaster replaces dead students with new arrivals and begins their orientation. Slaying the arcanaloth forces Wormriddle to step up and assume the mantle of headmaster, backed by her flesh golem guards. If the night hag is also slain, all the remaining students promptly turn on each other. Elan Tanor'thaljoins forces with Cephalossk to challenge Spite Harrowdale, Nylas Jowd tries to kill the Horned Sisters one by one, and Skrianna Shadowdusk waits to see how these conflicts play out before going after the survivors. Any students who remain standing gather what valuables they can from their fallen peers and flee Dweomercore.</p></div>

He is no longer human, having grafted his upper torso onto the body of a giant scorpion.</p><p>With no hope of repelling the drow on his own and no help coming from Halaster, Muiral does his best to hold on to what he has left. Any intrusion into his domain is met with deadly force.</p><p>To determine where the characters first encounter Muiral, roll a d20 and consult the following  <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">To determine where the characters first meet Vlonwelv and her retinue, roll a d20 and consult the following table:   d20  Vlonwelv's location  1-5  Area 25b  6-15</ref> Area 26 16-20 Area 27a</p><p>Treasure.

Vlonwelv has come to trust Zress more than she does her own children, keeping her adopted daughter close by. When determining Vlonwelv's starting location, assume Zress accompanies her.</p><p>If you have Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, use the drow house captain stat block in that book to represent Zress. Otherwise, Zress is a drow champion (see appendix A), with these changes:</p><p>• Zress is neutral evil.</p><p>• She has these racial traits: She speaks Elvish and</p><p>Undercommon. She has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put her to sleep. She has darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. She can innately cast dancing lights at-will, and darkness, faerie fire , and levitate (self only) each once per day. Her spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). While in sunlight, she has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p><p>Treasure. Zress wears mithral armor (plate). Affixed to her spider silk cloak is an obsidian scarab engraved with the insignia of House Auvryndar (25 gp).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GORZIL'S GANG</head><p>Vlonwelv has twenty troglodytes in her service. One of them is a fat, loathsome specimen named Gorzil. A follower of the reptile god Laogzed, Gorzil secretly hopes to depose Vlonwelv, seize control of Muiral's Gauntlet, and turn it into a troglodyte warren. His dreams, however, far exceed his grasp.</p><p>The drow have trained Gorzil's gang to wear armor and fight with swords. All the members are troglodytes, with these changes:</p><p>• Each troglodyte wears a breastplate (AC 14) and wields a longsword, which it uses instead of its claws. • As an action on its turn, a troglodyte can make two attacks with its longsword instead of attacking with its bite and claws. It wields the longsword with two hands and deals 7 (ldlO + 2) s lashing damage on a hit.</p><p>• The troglodytes understand Undercommon but can't speak it. </p></div>

Its 20-foot-wide, 30-foot-high corridors have arched ceilings bridged at regular intervals by web-like latticework arches serving as buttresses and rafters. Many of these "web arches" are cracked and broken. Shattered pieces of these arches lie scattered across the floor, as well as the remains of broken stone braziers carved in the shape of spiders. The bones of interlopers slain by Muiral also litter the dungeon.</p><p>The 15-foot-tall double doors found throughout this level are carved with web patterns, their features chipped and worn. Characters who pass through this hall might catch fleeting glimpses of Halaster reflected in the mirror shards instead of their own reflections-one of the Mad Mage's harmless regional effects (see "Halaster's Lair," page 311).</p></div>

The drow priestess Vlonwelv uses this device to broadcast propaganda, proselytize, summon subordinates, marshal forces, and taunt interlopers. As the characters make their way through Muiral's Gauntlet, they hear one or more ofVlonwelv's announcements echo throughout the dungeon, her words spoken in Elvish. A few trans lations include the fol lowing:</p><p>• "The Spider Queen blesses House Auvryndar! The battle to break House Freth's hold on the passages below brings victory after victory.

(Originating from gas vents under the floor, these flames shed bright light in a 15foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet.) Corpses.

The spiders quickly enshroud the a ltar and attack all creatures within 5 feet of it, pursuing prey that fl ees. If they are left alone, the spiders crawl back into the altar and disappear after 1 hour, whereupon the trap resets.</p><p>During his last visit to the nave, Muiral took any items of value from the dead adventurers. Characters who inspect the corpses find the following:</p><p>• The northern corpse (that of Kravos, a tiefiing rogue)</p><p>wears leather armor and clutches a shortsword. Necrotic energy causes his flesh to shrivel. • The southern corpse (that of Zundra Underdottir, a dwarf barbarian) wears hide armor and has a greataxe lying nearby. Her face is frozen in a horrific scream.</p><p>If a character casts speak with dead on a corpse and asks what it knows about Undermountain, the corpse shares a secret determined by drawing a card from the Secrets Deck (see appendix C).

Any humanoid wearing the helm gains the following flaw until the helm is removed: 'Tm exceedingly stubborn and think I'm right all the time." (This flaw supersedes any conflicting flaw.) Before he died, Falkir swallowed a gemstone called the Eye of the Spider. If the characters pierce the skin clinging to his bones and root through his chest cavity, they find the stone in what was once his stomach.

Any creature that beholds the statue in any of its forms must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or gain a random form of short-term madness (determined by rolling on the S hort-Term Madness table in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master 's Guide).

Etched on the floor of the dais are the words "Flattery will get you everywhere." Statues. Flanking the dais are two petrified hook horrors that look like carved statues. (The hook horrors pose no danger in their current state. Casting a greater restoration spell or similar magic on one restores it to flesh and blood, whereupon it attacks.)</p><p>The mirror looks like one of Halaster's magic gates and functions similarly (see "Gates," page 12). Its rules are as follows:</p><p>If a creature stands atop the dais and says something flattering about Halaster, the mirror vanishes, revealing a dusty corridor beyond that leads off into darkness. This corridor is an illusion. Ghaunadaur, a god of subterranean horrors, is respected and feared by many Underdark races, including drow. This temple contains the following features:</p><p>Green Slime. Each 10-foot-wide, lS-foot-high section of vertical wall is covered with six S-foot-square patches of green slime (see "Dungeon Hazards" in chapter S of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Secret Door. The slime obscures a secret door. Ability checks made to search the walls for secret doors are made with disadvantage until the slime is scraped off the section of wall in which the secret door is hidden. Altar. What appears at first viewing to be a glistening altar of variegated gray stone is, in fact, a hollow glass altar with three psychic gray oozes sealed inside it.</p><p>The glass altar is a Large object with AC 11, SS hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons that aren't adamantine, and immunity to acid, poison, and psychic damage.</p><p>The gray oozes attack all creatures that enter the room using their Psychic Crush action option (see the "Variant: Psychic Gray Oozes" sidebar in the "Oozes" entry in the Monster Manual). While contained in the altar, the oozes have total cover, their speed is 0 feet, and they can't attack with their pseudopods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>17B. TEMPLE OF KIARANSALEE</head><p>This temple of Kiaransalee, drow god of undeath, reeks of decay and contains the following:</p><p>Altar. An altar made of humanoid skulls and bones rests near the south wall. Decor and Secret Door. Embedded in the walls are drow skeletons posed as if dancing. One skeleton along the south wall is missing its head (behind it is a secret door that won't budge).</p><p>Only an undead creature or a creature possessed by one can open this secret door without the aid of a knock spell or similar magic.</p><p>If a character kneels before the altar and offers a prayer to Kiaransalee, or leaves a respectful offering on the altar, the room grows markedly colder as the silent ghost of a drow priestess materializes next to the altar and tries to possess the nearest humanoid creature. The altar refuses to budge. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around and above it. Any object weighing 10 pounds or less that is left unattended atop the altar rises until it is levitating 1 foot above the surface. This levitation field can't be dispelled but is suppressed in an antimagic field.</p><p>If a humanoid presses its cut hand (even a superficial wound will do) into the altar's hand-shaped indentation, the secret door in the south wall swings open. A knock spell or similar magic also opens the door.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>17D. TEMPLE OF VHAERAUN</head><p>This temple ofVhaeraun, drow god of thieves and assassins, contains the following features:</p><p>Assassin's Altar. An altar of blood-red stone stands near the south wall. Xarann A'Daragon, a male drow assassin, prays silently before it. Curtains. Three black curtains hang from iron hooks along the west, south, and east walls. Secret Door. A secret door hidden in the wall behind the south curtain opens only when certain conditions are met (see below).</p><p>A character who examines a curtain and succeeds on a DC 19 Wisdom (Perception) check notices the slightly darker silhouette of a drow sewn into it. If the characters find the silhouette in one curtain, they gain advantage on checks made to spot the silhouette hidden in each of the other two curtains. Each silhouette makes a sign with one of its hands; drow characters recognize these hand-signs that, collectively, spell out the Elvish phrase oloth elgg ssussun, which translates to "darkness slays light." If a creature makes these hand-signs in the proper order anywhere in the room, the secret door in the south wall swings open. A knock spell or similar magic also opens the door.</p><p>Xarann A' Daragon. Xarann, a spy for House Freth, is posing as a House Auvryndar assassin. He came here to pray to Vhaeraun before setting out on two missions: the rescue ofTazirahc Oussar (see area 19) and the assassination of Vlonwelv Auvryndar.</p><p>Xarann is initially friendly toward the characters. In exchange for their help killing the guards in area 18b and rescuing Tazirahc in area 19, Xarann will show them the way to level 11. If they agree to help kill Vlonwelv, Xarann will show them where the drow priestess Xarann is a drow assassin , with these changes:</p><p>• Xarann is neutral evil. He has these racial traits: He speaks Elvish and Undercommon. He has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put him to sleep. He has darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. He can innately cast dancing lights at-will, and darkness, faerie fire, and levitate (self only) each once per day. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 11). While in sunlight, he has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on s ight.</p><p>Treasure. Xarann wears a piwafwi, a drow-made cloak of elvenkind. It loses its magic if exposed to sunlight for 1 hour without interruption. Pinned to this cloak is an obsidian scarab engraved with the insignia of House Auvryndar. Xarann has a similar scarab, this one engraved with the symbol of House Freth, tucked in his belt. Each scarab is worth 25 gp.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>17E. TEMPLE OF EILISTRAEE</head><p>This temple of Eilistraee, god of beauty, dance, and the hunt, features the following:</p><p>Mus ic. A hymn magically plays throughout the temple. Secret Door. A secret door in the south wall opens only when the name of the hymn is spoken aloud. Altar. A beautifully carved stone altar supports a harpshaped sculpture. Worked into the harp's design is a female elf carved to look like she is leaping into the air, carefree, with her head and arms thrown back.</p><p>Examination of the altar reveals Elvish runes worked into the harp. Any character who understands Elvish can translate the words as "The hymn is the key."</p><p>A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Religion) check recognizes the hymn as "Bwaelan Dro," or "It's Good to Be Alive," an elven song of celebration. Elves and half-elves have advantage on this check. If the hymn's name is spoken aloud anywhere in the temple, in either Common or Elvish, the secret door in the south wall swings open. A knock spell or similar magic also opens the secret door.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="18.">FIRST B LO OD</head><p>If the characters have forged an alliance with Xarann A'Daragon (see area 17d), he goes on ahead of them and distracts the drow in area 18b, allowing the characters to gain surprise.</p></div>

If Vlonwelv is still alive, the characters also hear her disembodied voice as they make their way down this hallway for the first time (see "Vlonwelv's Pulpit," page 138). Thirteen of the male drow are standing in a circle around Drinrith and the fourteenth male drow, who are engaged in a duel. When Drinrith draws blood or knocks the male to the ground, she either replaces him with a new challenger or orders two other males to fight one another while she barks criticism.</p><p>If the characters aJlow Xarann A'Daragon to distract the room's occupants, he challenges Drinrith to a oneon-one fight. Drinrith accepts the challenge, prompting the males to shout cheers and jibes during the protracted battle and granting the characters advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to surprise the drow and the giant spiders while the contest rages.</p><p>Treasure. Drinrith wears an obsidian scarab engraved with the insignia of House Auvryndar (25 gp) and a platinum-inlaid helm of black metal molded in the likeness of a spider with carnelians for eyes (750 gp).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="19.">I NTERROGATION ROOM</head><p>Characters who listen at the double door hear tortured screams coming from beyond. Once used as a kitchen, this 20-foot-high room has been mostly cleaned out.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interrogation. A male drow mage named Kereth</head><p>Ichorzza and a summoned quasit are interrogating a male drow named Tazirahc Oussar, who is bound to an iron chair with spider s ilk. Observers. Observing the interrogation are two male drow elite warriors named Gelgos Argonrae and Jevan Kron'tayne.</p><p>When not serving as the consort of Drinrith Auvryndar (see area 18b), Kereth is tasked with interrogating drow accused of being House Freth spies. The quasit has already used its Scare action option on Tazirahc, and Kereth is preparing to zap the prisoner with a ray of frost cantrip, hoping he'll divulge the identities of other House Freth spies in their midst.</p><p>The drow attack characters who interfere in the interrogation. Once Kereth and his cronies are dealt with, characters can cut through Tazirahc's bonds and release him if they so desire. If Xarann A'Daragon (see area 17d) is with the party, he questions Tazirahc to make sure he didn't divulge any compromising information.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>24A. GUARD POST</head><p>A foul stench wafts through the double door, which stands ajar. This partially collapsed room is empty except for piles of rubble and six troglodytes wielding longswords and wearing breastplates (see "Gorzil's Gang," page 136). The troglodytes attack anything that isn't a troglodyte or a drow. If the adventuring party includes one or more drow characters or NPCs, the troglodytes bow their heads and wait for new orders, obeying any command from a drow that isn't clearly suicidal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>24B. TuNNELS</head><p>These naturally formed tunnels wind through collapsed rooms and hallways. The walls are composed of jagged stones, and the floor throughout is s ilty and wet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>24c. MORGUE</head><p>A foul stench wafts through the double door, which stands ajar. Piled near the tunnels at the back of the room are the stripped corpses of eight drow and sixteen troglodytes in varying stages of decay. Feasting on the remains are seven drow ghouls that were created by Vlonwelv to devour the dead. The ghouls retreat into the back tunnels when one or more drow enter the room. If a drow is not among those who enter, the ghouls attack.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="25.">AUVRYNDAR HALL</head><p>This hall was once a market where the drow kept and sold slaves. It now serves as House Auvryndar's main military stronghold in Undermountain. IfVlonwelv Auvryndar is here, the drow priestess is seated on the throne in the southern alcove (area 25b), listening totedious reports of the battles waging against House Freth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>25A. HALL OF THE DARK SELDARINE</head><p>Any character who tries to sneak into this room must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity (Stealth) check, made with disadvantage due to the large number of guards.</p><p>Fountain. The centerpiece of this immense, 80-foothigh room is a 60-foot-diameter fountain adorned with eight statues that represent the Dark Seldarine (the drow pantheon). Cracked tiles fanning out from the fountain form a web-like mosaic on the floor. Guards. Fifteen drow guards are scattered throughout the room. They defend this chamber to the death. Giant Lizards. Two giant lizards fitted with saddles, reins, and stirrups are parked in the southeast corner. These docile reptiles are used as mounts by the drow scouts in area 25b and have the Spider Climb trait (see the "Variant: Giant Lizard Traits" sidebar in appendix A of the Monster Manual). Slave Pen. A stone enclosure in the northwest corner serves as a s lave pen. Band music emanates from within.</p><p>The fountain is fed by a natural spring and provides the drow with a virtually endless supply of fresh water. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>House AuvRVNOllR</head><p>The statues stand atop stone plinths above the water, facing outward. Starting with the northernmost one and moving clockwise, the statues represent Eilistraee (god of beauty, dance, and the hunt), Malyk (god of wild magic), Kiaransalee (god of undeath), Ghaunadaur (god of oozes, slimes, and all things subterranean), Zinzerena (god of assassins), Vhaeraun (god of thieves), Lolth (the Demon Queen of Spiders and mother of the Dark Seldarine) in her drow form, and Selvetarm (god of war and warriors).</p><p>This 40-foot-square slave pen has 20-foot-high walls of smooth stone. Instead of a roof, it has a 5-foot-thick covering of sticky webs. The webs provide an effective barrier, and any creature that enters the webs or starts its turn in them is restrained. A restrained creature can use its action to try to pull itself out of the webs, doing so with a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. Each 10-foot-square section of webs has AC 10, 10 hit points, vulnerability to fire, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and psychic damage.</p><p>A sturdy iron-barred gate set into the east wall is held shut with an arcane lock spell that only drow can ignore.</p><p>Forcing the gate open requires a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check.</p><p>The slave pen is lined with straw. It contains a halfting musical quintet that the drow kidnapped just outside the town of Daggerford. The performers call themselves the Sing-Alongs, and they're quite good. Vlonwelv makes sure that they're fed and treated well; in exchange, they fill her hall with music. The members and their instruments are Peeta Brightmoon (drum), Kevin Gladriver Although the halfting musicians are grateful for the kind treatment of their drow captors, they have grown weak from eating nothing but mushrooms and would like to return to the surface. They have little hope of reaching Waterdeep on their own and would appreciate an escort. Getting all five band members to the Yawning Portal alive completes this quest. Durnan is pleased to have the halftings perform for his patrons and rewards the characters with a round of drinks. If the heroes plan to return to Undermountain, Durnan also pulls a few strings to secure a potion of superior healing for each of them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>25B . SPIDER THRONE</head><p>Throne. This large alcove contains a spider-shaped throne. A red crystal orb is set into a fixture at the end of one armrest. Mirror. Mounted to the east wall is a tall, rectangular mirror with an ornate stone frame. The mirror is one of Halaster's gates (see "Gates," page 12).</p><p>IfVlonwelv is here, the drow priestess ofLolth is seated on the throne, flanked by her drow champion, Zress (see "Zress Orlezziir," page 136) and a yochlol advisor that has assumed the form of a female drow wearing a spider silk robe with a cowl. Kneeling before the priestess are two male drow scouts named Llossul and Yuinfein, who have recently returned from a reconnaissance mission on level 11. If Vlonwelv isn't present, Llossul and Yuinfein are here waiting for her to return.</p><p>The throne is a Large object with AC 18, 80 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around the throne itself and a separate aura of evocation magic around the throne's red crystal orb.</p><p>Any creature other than an elf that sits on the throne or starts its turn there must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4dl0) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature seated on the throne and touching the orb can use a bonus action to broadcast its voice to every location in Muiral's Gauntlet. The orb loses its magic if it is torn free of the throne, or if the throne is destroyed.</p><p>Mirror Gate to Level 8. The mirror's frame is composed of an assemblage of hundreds of tiny, interlocking stone gears. The rules of this gate are as follows:</p><p>• Any creature that inspects the frame and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check sees that one of The mages aren't expecting attacks from the east. If combat erupts in area 25a or 25b, Syrrak investigates while Gorthax and the crystal spider remain here. A battle in this hall brings reinforcements from area 30a.</p><p>The spider golem understands Elvish but can't speak. It obeys Gorthax's commands.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WHAT DWELLS HERE?</head><p>This level is a battleground between drow of House Freth and a tribe of minotaurs. The minotaurs hold sway over a maze of tunnels riddled with magical effects and traps, while the drow occupy the caves around an elegant fortress called Spiderwatch Keepa staging ground for House Freth's goal of conquering all of Undermountain.</p><p>Hostilities between the drow and the minotaurs have recently abated, in the wake of devastating losses on both sides. Drivvin Freth, a drow archmage, hopes to use this respite to his house's advantage by summoning a goristro demon that will force the minotaurs to submit to House Freth's control.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H O USE FRETH</head><p>From their dark bastion, the leaders of the house strive to keep their enemies, House Auvryndar (see level 10), from conquering the Troglodyte Warrens (level 11). Leading the effort is Erelal Freth, a drow priestess of Lolth. Her older brother Drivvin works at her side.</p><p>Erelal has communed with Lolth and believes that the key to securing the Troglodyte Warrens begins with the capitulation of the minotaurs on the Maze Level. Once the minotaurs are s ubservient to House Freth, the drow will use them to clear out and secure the warrens. To this end, Drivvin is devising a ritual to summon and control a goristro demon. By passing the goristro off as Baphomet, the demon lord of minotaurs, he hopes to win the minotaurs' obedience. But Drivvin has recently realized that his arcane knowledge is not sufficient to allow him to perfect the ritual-and he's afraid of admitting his inadequacy to his sister.</p><p>The nature of the characters' prior association with House Auvryndar might affect how members of House Freth view them. If the characters collaborated with House Auvryndar and this fact becomes known to the leaders of House Freth, all future encounters with members of House Freth are likely to be hostile.</p></div>

Their leader is a priest of Baphomet named Maku, a devout follower of the Horned King who has tried to summon the demon lord on numerous occasions. The minotaur priest believes that his ritual will be successful if he can amass a large enough pile of mutilated corpses for the demon lord to feast on.</p></div>

He appears as a great, black-furred minotaur with iron horns, burning red fire in his eyes, and a massive bloodstained glaive. Fervent human cultists of Baphomet are sometimes transformed into minotaurs as a reward for their devotion and sacrifice.</p></div>

At the end of the west tunnel, a tall oval mirror framed in stone hangs on the rocky wall. The mirror' s frame is carved with vines that twist through eleven actual humanoid skulls mounted to the frame. Carved into the bottom of the frame are the following words in Celestial: "The dead know the secret."</p><p>The mirror is one of Halaster's gates (see "Gates," page 12). Its rules are as follows:</p><p>• Speaking the proper command word while standing in front of the mirror opens the gate for 1 minute. • Characters must be 11th level or higher to pass through this gate (see ''.Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12). • A creature that passes through the gate appears in area lle on level 10, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.</p><p>Casting speak with dead on one of the skulls forces it to reveal the gate's command word ("Axallian"), which Halaster changes every few days.

Stalagmites and floor-to-ceiling columns of rock are scattered across the area, the fog flowing slowly around them. Seven minotaurs lurk behind the stalagmites and rock columns.</p><p>The minotaurs are stationed throughout the cavern, guarding against a drow attack. They are famished, having been forced to sacrifice their food for Maku's ritual (see area 8a). They spring out when they see or hear any creatures in this area, charging intruders and ignoring any attempts to parley. The minotaurs fight to the death and loudly devour their kills if they are victorious. Any sound of combat in this area brings the five minotaurs in area 7b as reinforcements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7B. NORTHERN CAVE</head><p>This cave has the same features as area 7a. Five minotaurs stand watch in this area and attack in response to any intrusion. The sound of combat here brings the seven m inotaurs from area 7a as reinforcements.</p></div>

As the characters approach this 50-foothigh cave, they hear minotaurs chanting and stomping. This area contains the following:</p><p>Minotaurs. The fog swirls through this cavern, agitated by the dancing of eleven chanting minotaurs. Offal Pile. Low stone barriers constrain a massive pile of rotting, dismembered body parts. The minotaurs are led by Maku, who has 117 hit points, wears a shawl made of drow entrails, and clutches a brass horn (see "Treasure" below). The minotaur shaman treats all intruders as enemies to be carved up and added to his pile of dismembered bodies. His first action in combat is to blow his brass horn while the other minotaurs try to hack intruders to pieces.</p><p>Baphomet does not answer prayers, nor does the demon lord have any interest in Maku's tribe. As such, the minotaur shaman's ritual has no chance of working. But the sacrifices performed in this area have saturated the cave with evil power, such that any humanoid that makes a weapon attack in this area must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be cursed with blood lust. While cursed in this way, the creature is hostile toward all other creatures it can see and must use its action each turn to attack the creature closest to it. (If multiple targets are equally close, the target is determined randomly.) Greater restoration, remove curse, or similar magic ends the blood lust on a creature. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw against this effect is immune to it for the next 24 hours.</p><p>The altar is made out of two minotaurs that were killed and devoured in a cannibalistic ritual. Any creature that touches the altar experiences a ghastly vision of being torn apart and eaten by minotaurs.</p><p>Treasure. Maku carries a horn of the Endless Maze. This wondrous item functions as a brass horn of Valhalla, except that the warrior spirits it summons come from the Abyss and look like minotaurs.</p><p>A single character can search through the pile of body parts in 1 hour, while multiple characters working together can reduce the search time proportionally. A detect magic spell can further expedite a specific search for magic items. The search yields a spider silk pouch containing 50 gp, two obsidian scarabs engraved with the insignia of House Freth (25 gp each), a jeweled anklet (750 gp), and one of a pair of gloves of missile snaring worn on the severed limb of its previous drow owner. (The matching glove can be found in area 8b.)</p></div>

Hidden under the fog in the northern alcove is a treasure pile (see "Treasure" below). Standing Stones. At the south end of the cave are two 15-foot-tall standing stones hewn from black basalt. Carved into the lintel stone spanning them is a large blood-red X.</p><p>Standing Gate to Level 19. The standing stones form one of Ha laster's magic gates (see "Gates," page 12). When a creature comes within 5 feet of the gate, rivulets of blood begin to seep from the standing stones. The rules of this gate are as follows: Treasure. Characters who find the treasure in the north alcove discover a set of weaver's tools, fourteen shortswords and six hand crossbows of drow manufacture, a sack of mushroom flour, a spider silk satchel containing 8 days of rations (dry moss and mushrooms), a silver holy symbol of Lolth (25 gp), and a glove of missile snaring (the matching glove can be found in area 8a).

All four are crouched down in the fog.</p><p>Llorelve and Vorljas spring up at the first sounds of creatures approaching this area, and they attack anyone they don't recognize. Any humanoids they don't know are assumed to be allied with House Auvryndar.</p><p>When either incubus is reduced to 30 hit points or fewer, it uses its next action to become ethereal and doesn't rejoin the battle.

A creature that steps on the breakaway floor falls into the pit, taking 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall and 10 (3d6) piercing damage from the spikes.</p><p>The pit remains open once the breakaway floor falls away.

(If the fog is cleared away, d row, quaggoth, and giant lizard tracks can be seen in the guano. The tracks go in all directions, but most lead west toward the drow fortress .) Bat Alarm. Hundreds of bats cling to the 30-foot-high domed ceiling. The drow use the bats as an alarm of sorts, knowing that the creatures become agitated and expect to be fed whenever humanoids enter the cave. Web Cables. The tunnels leading to areas 12a and 12b rise up out of the fog and a re strung with web cables.</p><p>The drow release crickets into this area to feed the bats. Expecting to be fed, the bats start to shriek and flap about the cave when the characters arrive, alerting the drow guards in areas 12a, 12b, and 18a. Undead. Six minotaur skeletons stand in the middle of the cave, ready to attack any creature that isn't a drow. Drow. Four male drow elite warriors hide in the deadend tunnels to the south. Any character who has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 20 or higher spots these guards. Standing Stones . The northern part of the cave contains two large standing stones, each of which has an inanimate minotaur skeleton embedded in it.</p><p>If a battle erupts here, the drow in area 12b use signal horns to sound the alarm before joining the fight. They are quickly joined by reinforcements from areas 12c and 12d.</p><p>These drow are well trained, and their loyalty to House Freth is beyond question. Their leader, Tanimar Freth, is the second of Erelal's three sons. He lost his right eye in a sword fight against a House Auvryndar rival; his empty eye socket and scar are plain for all to see. One consequence of his injury is that Tanimar has been relegated to guard duty. He fights alongside his younger brother, Xaphtal Freth. The other two drow are named Hexab Do'ett and Moltar Barrek'zorn.</p><p>If the battle turns against them, the d row use darkness spells to cover their retreat to the fortress (area 18).</p><p>They know the tunnels well enough to navigate them blindly. Xaphtal seizes any opportunity to dispose of his older brother, provided the risk to himself is minimal. The other drow are not surprised by Xaphtal's treachery-Tanimar least of all.</p><p>S tanding Gate. The standing stones form one of Halaster's magic gates (see "Gates," page 12). Its rules are as follows:</p><p>• Any creature that touches one of the standing stones is targeted by a maze spell (save DC 22).</p><p>• To open the gate, a creature must be trapped in the maze created by the spell, then escape. When the creature returns to the space it left, the gate opens for 1 minute. • Characters must be 13th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10).

It has AC 19, 80 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Its ability scores are as follows: Strength 18, Dexterity 10, Constitution 10, Intelligence 3, Wisdom 3, and Charisma 1. Its climbing and walking speeds are 30 feet, and it can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. It has blindsight out to a range of 60 feet and is blind beyond this radius.</p><p>As an action, the iron spider can shoot out a 6-inchthick web cable up to 50 feet long, attaching the far end of the cable to a solid surface up to 50 feet away from it. As a bonus action, it can detach the other end of the cable from itself and attach it to a solid surface within 10 feet of it. Once it creates 200 feet of web cable, the spider can't produce any more cable until the next dawn. The iron spider exists solely to produce web cables. It has no attacks and no instinct for self-preservation.</p><p>Like a scaladar, the iron spider has a control ring (possessed by Drivvin Freth). The iron spider obeys the commands of whoever wears its control ring. The spider is incapacitated in the area of an anti magic field spell. If targeted by a dispel magic spell, the spider must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.</p></div>

The worm doesn't fill the entire tunnel, so smaller creatures can try to slip past it. When the worm enters a smaller creature's space for the first time on a turn, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature avoids being crushed between the worm and the tunnel wall. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (4dl0) bludgeoning damage.</p></div>

The pen currently holds five adult troglodytes and four troglodyte children (Small noncombatants), as well as a minotaur chained to the ground.

Each of the guard towers (areas l 8a through l 8d) is utilitarian and unfurnished. A tower has the following features and defenses:</p><p>• The tower's stone doors are reinforced and barred from the inside. Siege weapons are needed to break them down. • Arrow slits on the first and second floors provide three-quarters cover to those standing behind them. The rooftop battlements provide variable cover, depend ing on the angle of attack. • Iron ladders and trapdoors connect each level of a tower, and the trapdoor in the roof can be bolted shut from below. Breaking through a bolted trapdoor requires a successful DC 27 Strength (Athletics) check. • Each tower contains eight male drow (four on each of the first and second floors) who fire light crossbows through the arrow slits. This attack is the same as the drow's hand crossbow attack, except it has a range of 80/320 feet and deals 6 (ld8 + 2) piercing damage. • A male drow mage stands watch on the rooftop.</p><p>Characters who have House Freth escorts or who wear clever drow disguises can approach the fortress openly.

The male drow with her are Chaszantar and Ulgreth, two sycophants vying to become her new consort. They both wear spider silk togas instead of armor, giving them AC 12.</p><p>Erelal is a mere thirty days away from giving birth to her eleventh child, but she refuses to let her pregnancy interfere with her work: the destruction of House Drivvin is a drow archmage, with these changes:</p><p>• He is neutral evil.</p><p>• He has these racial traits: He speaks Abyssal, Common, Dwarvish, Elvish, Goblin, and Undercommon. He has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put him to sleep. He has darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. He can innately cast dancing lights at will, and can cast darkness, faerie fire, and levitate (self only) each once per day. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). While in sunlight, he has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. • He has cast mind blank on himself.</p><p>• Once per day as an action, Drivvin can summon a demon that has a challenge rating of 6 or lower. The summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of him, acts as his ally, and can't summon other demons. The summoned demon remains until Drivvin dismisses it as an action or until the demon is reduced to 0 hit points.</p><p>If a fight breaks out here, Drivvin uses his first action in combat to cast time stop. He uses the extra time granted by the spell to summon a barlgura and cast fire shield on himself, as well as mage armor and stoneskin if he hasn't done so already. Drivvin fights to the finish to defend his sister. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AFTERMATH</head><p>If the characters fail to defeat Drivvin Freth, the drow archmage agrees to serve Halaster as an apprentice in exchange for the Mad Mage's help in summoning and binding a goristro. The summoning ritual takes 30 days to prepare, and it is performed by Drivvin and Halaster in the courtyard of the drow fortress.</p><p>When the demon appears, Halaster traps it in a 5,000 gp ruby and gives the gemstone to Drivvin. Under the cloak of an invisibility spell, Drivvin takes the gem to area 8a and breaks it, releasing the goristro there. Mistaking the demon for an emissary of Baphomet, the minotaurs watch as it devours the carrion in area 8a. When it has no more carrion to feed on, it begins devouring whatever it can kill. Once its hunger is satisfied, the demon sends its new minotaur lackeys to kill everything on level 11 and bring it more food to eat. The goristro considers any drow wearing the insignia of House Freth to be its ally, and orders its minotaurs to go forth and slay all other creatures.</p><p>If Erelal Freth survives, she gives birth to her eighth daughter, Amalica, and continues to wage war against House Auvryndar and its allies. Amalica's birth is viewed as a sign of Lolth's favor, renewing House Freth's resolve and turning the tide in its favor. Several houses formerly allied with House Auvryndar switch sides and send emissaries to Erelal with gifts for her blessed newborn.</p><p>If Erelal and Drivvin perish, House Freth's allies abandon the house out of fear that Lolth has forsaken them. Without these allies, House Freth becomes too weak to defend itself against even its minotaur neighbors. The survivors hole up in the fortress while envoys are dispatched to the Underdark to secure reinforcements. Those reinforcements won't arrive in time if Vlonwelv Auvryndar (see level 10) has her way.</p></div>

They send hobgoblin minions to steal scrap metal, which the giants are using to build a great construct of their own. The hobgoblins raid in small bands, using trained rust monsters to distract Zox's constructs. These raiders are naturally violent but can be parlayed with by clever adventurers.</p><p>The hobgoblins recently figured out how Zox controls the scaladar, and now they aim to kill the gnome and take his control ring. So far, Zox has managed to elude all the hobgoblins sent to murder him.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">TUNNELS AND TRENCHES</head><p>Trobriand's bore worm created the tunnels that connect this level to levels 12 and 14. The worm also dug 20-foot-deep trenches through areas 2 and 11 on this level. These tunnels and trenches have been worn smooth by the worm's repeated passage. Scaling a tunnel or a trench wall without magic or climbing gear requires a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.</p><p>Arching bridges of stone span the trenches at three points. A character can try to leap off a bridge onto the bore worm's back as it passes underneath. Any character trying to do so must make a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a successful check, the character lands on the worm's back without taking damage or falling prone. On a failed check, the character slips and falls off the worm, landing prone in the trench and taking 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall.</p></div>

The cavern is dark aside from the intermittent light of welding sparks coming from the constructs' tail stingers. Arbalests. A dozen arbalests (use quadrone statistics) flit around the arch. Each arbalest resembles an oversized repeating crossbow with mechanical wings and four articulated metal legs. </p></div>

The scrap metal pile spills into area 2, dominates the cavern north of it, and completely fills the opening between the two caverns. The outer surface of the scrap pile is difficult terrain. In addition, any creature that tries to climb or walk across the jagged heap of metal must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to avoid triggering a small avalanche that causes it to fall prone and take 7 (2d6) piercing damage.</p><p>The entrances to the warren are marked with arrows on map 13. The warren contains the following:</p><p>Rus t Monsters. A rust monster gorges on scrap metal in each of the squares marked R on the map. Central Chamber. In the heart of the warren is a 30-foot-wide, 40-foot-long, 10-foot-high chamber containing four dead hobgoblins. Ten lava children (see appendix A) hide in the walls and emerge to attack anyone who enters the room.</p><p>The rust monsters tend to ignore other creatures that maintain a respectful distance. If a character wearing metal armor or carrying a metal shield walks within 5 feet of a rust monster, there's a 30 percent chance that the creature attacks the character with the intention of devouring the armor or shield.</p><p>The lava children walk through the scrap metal as though it doesn't exist. They regard Zox as a trusted friend and, at his request, attack creatures that enter the central chamber. The lava children pursue fleeing creatures as far as the warren entrances before disappearing back into the scrap metal. While they are hidden in the metal walls, the lava children have total cover.</p><p>The hobgoblins were sent to find and kill Zox Clammersham but fell prey to the lava children. A character who examines the corpses and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check ascertains that the hobgoblins were killed two days ago.

Three scaladar (see appendix A) patrol the tunnel. A character can try to pick a door's lock using thieves' tools, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. A knock spell or similar magic also works. A door can be forced open with a successful DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. It can also be destroyed. Each door has AC 19, 40 hit points, a damage threshold of 10, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</p><p>Zox has cast a glyph of warding spell on every door. Each glyph is inscribed on the inside of the door so that it can't be detected by anyone outside the palace. The glyph triggers when the door is opened by any means other than using the proper key. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on it. Each creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 31 (7d8) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The sound of a triggered glyph is audible throughout the cavern and the palace. Alerted to the presence of intruders, Zox awaits them in area 7c.</p><p>Illumination.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">Table. A 2-foot-high, roughly hexagonal table made of  welded scrap metal is covered with scavenged bits of  broken machinery and scraps of food.  Music. Tinny music emanates from the southern doorway (leading to area 7c).</ref> 7B. LIVING QUARTERS Pet. A giant badger playfully chews on a stuffed toy in the middle of the room. Furnishings. The dingy furnishings include an unmade bed, a drafting table, and an iron safe (see "Iron Safe" below). Alcoves. Alcoves to the south contain a poorly draining privy and a modest kitchenette where food molders in unclean pots and filthy pans. Arch. Set into the west wall is a stone arch decorated with inlaid images of dancing goblins. Carved into the arch's keystone is the letter D.</p><p>The giant badger fights only in self-defense. Characters who use magic to speak with it can learn the following information if they ask it the right questions:</p><p>• Zox is afraid of the "scary red metal wearers" (hobgoblins) and has befriended the "burning men" (azers) and "smileys" (lava children) that live in the surrounding caves. Zox has a bodyguard named Rex. • Zox normally gets food from the nearby fungus forest (see area 12), but the "scary red metal wearers" recently set the forest on fire. • The combination to Zox's iron safe is "prairie dog, wombat, badger, armadillo, wombat."</p><p>Arch Gate to Level 6. The arch embedded in the west wall is one of Halaster's magic gates (see "Gates," page 12). Its rules are as follows:</p><p>• The gate opens for 1 minute if a creature stands within 5 feet of the arch and either sings a D note or plays a D note on a musical instrument. • Characters must be at least 9th level to pass through this gate (see ''Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12). • A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 47a on level 6, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.</p><p>Iron Safe. The square iron safe measures 2 feet on a side and weighs 1,000 pounds. It has AC 19, 50 hit points, a damage threshold of 15, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Instead of numbers, the lock has tiny pictographs of the following burrowing animals: armadillo, badger, chipmunk, gerbil, meerkat, mole, prairie dog, rabbit, tarantula, and wombat.</p><p>A character who spends 1 minute with an ear pressed to the safe door can try to pick the safe's combination lock, doing so with a successful DC 25 Dexterity (Perception) check. The correct combination is prairie dog, wombat, badger, armadillo, wombat. A knock spell or similar magic also opens the safe. Rex the shield guardian accompanies Zox wherever he goes. Unlike most shield guardians, Rex doesn't have an amulet and thus can't be commanded by another creature. Zox has stored a greater invisibility spell in the shield guardian.</p><p>Zox Clammersham is a rock gnome archmage, with these changes:</p><p>• Zox is chaotic good.</p><p>• He has these racial traits: He speaks Aquan, Auran, Common, Gnomish, Ignan, and Terran. He is Small and has a walking speed of 25 feet. He has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. He has advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic. • He has the confusion spell prepared instead of banishment.</p><p>Zox retired to Trobriand's Graveyard after the rest of his adventuring party fell prey to the perils of Undermountain. Having lost all track of time, he doesn't know how long ago his companions perished or how long he's been by himself. Zox has no interest in joining another adventuring party, preferring to work alone.</p><p>Zox carries a key that unlocks the palace doors, and he wears a scaladar control ring on the middle finger of his left hand. This ring allows him to command the scaladar on this level. He never willingly parts with the ring, going so far as to swallow it to prevent its theft. If attacked or threatened, Zox activates the room's ball turrets, then orders his shield guardian to attack.</p><p>Zox's music box has no magical properties beyond its ability to play a tune. The music plays continuously but stops if the box is dropped, shaken, or otherwise handled roughly. The box is a Tiny object with AC 10, 1 hit point, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Provided it has 1 hit point, the box can be repaired with tinker's tools. Repairing it requires 10 minutes and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check, whereupon the music resumes playing.</p><p>Zox plans to use the Simulacrux (see area 2a) to create enough scaladar to build new things and comfortably control what he now views as his domain. The biggest obstacles to his success are the hobgoblins that keep stealing his scrap metal. Runes carved on the inside walls of the forge channel magical energy from the Elemental Plane of Fire. Destroying a forge causes it to stop generating fire and heat. Each forge has AC 17, 80 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AZERS</head><p>The azers were brought here from the Elemental Plane of Fire by Trobriand to sculpt metal into desired shapes. Posing as Trobriand's apprentice, Zox orders the azers to craft parts for the Simulacrux (see area 2a) and his other pet projects. The azers understand the purpose of the Simulacrux (to replicate scaladar) but are under the false impression that Zox is building it at Trobriand's behest, not for his own ends. The azers are frustrated by Zox because the gnome is scatterbrained and has them working on multiple projects at once. They strongly dislike the hobgoblins, who rob them of metal.</p><p>A character can convince an azer to undertake a new project with a successful DC 19 Charisma (Persuasion) check. The azer works for free and can craft a functional metal weapon or a metal shield in ld6 days, or a functional suit of metal armor in 3d6 days.</p><p>The azers are nonthreatening. If the lava children attack the party, the azers don't join the fight, preferring to observe from the periphery.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LAVA CHILDREN</head><p>Lava children can pass through metal as though it doesn't exist. Those here lurk in the pile of scrap metal, emerging to attack any creature, other than Zox or the azers, that comes within 5 feet of their scrap heap.</p></div>

The western pool holds liquid iron, the eastern pool liquid steel. Despite being liquefied, the metal is cool to the touch. A detect magic spell reveals a strong aura of transmutation magic emanating from each pool. No matter how much metal is removed from a pool, its depth never changes.</p><p>Metal removed from the pool solidifies instantly, becoming as strong and immutable as wrought iron or cold steel. The metal instantly hardens upon leaving the pool and forms a hard coating around anything dipped in it. Prying off the hardened metal coating requires a successful DC 23 Strength (Athletics) check.</p><p>Those who know how can draw metal from the pools in cube form. A creature might learn the method by casting identify on a pool or by asking Zox <ref type="table" target="#tab_75">. A creature must  place one or more of its hands within 1 foot of the pool's  surface and recite the following in Terran: agrach taar  azlach (which, loosely translated to Common, means  "shape to shapelessness"). This causes a cubic foot of  liquid metal to rise out of the pool, harden into a solid  1-foot cube, and hang weightless in the air at the edge</ref>  </p></div>

Stalactites ranging in height from 10 to 20 feet cling to the cave roof, while stalagmites of similar size thrust up from the floor. Monsters. Lurking behind the cluster of stalagmites to the north are five domesticated death dogs, four hobgoblins, and the hobgoblin warlord Yargoth the Breaker.</p><p>When Yargoth gives the order, she and the death dogs spring into melee combat while the other hobgoblins take cover behind the rock formations and shoot arrows. The hobgoblins in area llb also join the battle by loading, aiming, and firing the flame cannons in that location.</p><p>If the characters choose to parley with Yargoth, she suggests they combine forces and storm Zox's fortress. Yargoth knows that the fortress doors are locked and magically trapped, and that Zox is protected by a tall, golem-like construct (Rex the shield guardian). Yargoth wants Zox's scaladar control ring for her efforts; if the characters agree to help her, they are free to claim anything else they find in the fortress. Yargoth keeps her end of the deal, provided the characters do the same. Flame Cannon. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 3 (ld6) bludgeoning damage plus 17 (Sd6) fire damage, and the target catches fire . While on fire, the target takes ld6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by immersing itself in water or by using an action to make a successful DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.</p><p>The stone enclosure has a hinged gate made of sturdy wooden poles lashed together with rope and held shut with a simple latch. The hobgoblins like to starve the rust monsters for a few days, then set them loose on this level. The rust monsters can't escape from the pen on their own, but they are drawn to the scent of metal. The hobgoblins use the wooden tower shield and 10-foot poles to wrangle the rust monsters outside their pen and keep the beasts away from their metal armor.</p><p>Twelve giant fire beetle glands illuminate the rust monster pen.

Chanterella grew the purple mold and can silently command it to extrude sticky tendrils, which it uses to lower the potions within easy reach.</p><p>Sunlight, any effect that cures disease, or any effect that deals radiant or necrotic damage destroys the mold. If the mold is destroyed while the potions are still hidden in its mass, the potions fall and shatter on the floor.

If work on the project continues and Zox completes his arch, there's no telling whether it functions as intended. Scaladar simulacra created by the arch might be defective or uncontrollable.

Each wears a cloak pin bearing the insignia of House Freth. They arrived here shortly before the adve nturers and have greater invisibility spells cast on them. The drow and their two quasit companions try to remain hidden, allowing adventurers to move into Arcturiadoom ahead of them. Once the path is clear, they pass through areas 3 and 35 on their way to area 38.</p><p>One of their kin, Vanar, arrived early to scout and has already slipped inside. The characters might encounter him and his shadow demon in area 29.</p></div>

A search reveals three backpacks made of woven spiderwebs. Each pack contains a mess kit, 10 days of rations (dried mushrooms, moss, and boiled cockatrice eggs), 50 feet of spider silk rope, and a full water skin made from a lizard's bladder.</p></div>

DEFORMED DUERGA R Characters who enter this cave are soon attacked by a hideously deformed duergar. The creature has enlarged itself to a height of 9 feet. This creature used to be two separate duergar, a male named Blork and a female named Muatha. Arcturia fused them together into a single creature by using magic that only a wish spell can undo. Both skulls merged into one bulbous head that has three ears, three eyes, two noses, and two mouths. It has a third arm on the right side of its body, and its left leg splits into two at the knee, giving it three feet. The transformation drove the poor creature insane, and it regards all other creatures as threats that must be destroyed.</p><p>The creature is a duerga r, with these changes:</p><p>• The creature has 40 hit points.</p><p>• It has advantage on Wis dom (Perception) checks and on saving throws against being charmed, frightened, stunned, or knocked unconscious. • As a bonus action, it can make an attack with its javelin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2B. DuERGAR's CRIB</head><p>The deformed creature in area 2a sleeps here on a bed of spongy black mold that grows at the back of the cave. The crawlers are natural enemies of the creature in area 2a, which recently killed one of them with a blow from its war pick. They ignore characters who keep a respectful distance.</p><p>A character who studies the fungus and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Nature) check can distinguish edible varieties from poisonous ones, and also ascertains that the spore clouds are harmless. A character unaware of this information who eats fungus has a 50 percent chance of consuming a poisonous variety and must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for ld4 hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2D. STANDING GATE TO LEVEL 12</head><p>This cave contains a pair of standing stones with an inanimate minotaur skeleton embedded in each one, facing each other. These standing stones form one of Halaster's magic gates (see "Gates," page 12). The rules of the gate are as follows:</p><p>• Any creature that touches one of the standing stones is targeted by a maze spell (save DC 22).</p><p>• To open the gate, a creature must escape the labyrinth created by the maze spell. When it returns, the gate opens for 1 minute. • Characters must be 12th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12). • A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 12a on level 12, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.</p></div>

Two male fire giants (named Druvax and Zelzzarf) and seven hobgoblins are sorting through pieces of scrap iron on the floor and tossing them noisily into piles. Statues. Two statues of dwarves flank the double door to the southwest. Each statue stands atop a crumbling, 2-foot-high stone block. The statues have been magically reshaped in gruesome ways.</p><p>Arcturia used stone shape spells to mutilate the statues, which once depicted proud dwarf warriors. The statue to the west has stony pseudopods sprouting from it, while the statue to the south appears half-melted.</p><p>The giants and the hobgoblins aren't happy with drudge work and eagerly hurl themselves into combat if LEVEL 14 I ARCTURTADOOM the chance presents itself. The scrap iron was brought down from level 13 and will later be transported to area 14 to be eventually melted down and recast. <ref type="table" target="#tab_73">Arcturia confines living subjects here until she finds  time to experiment on them.

Lying in the southwest cell is a humanoid corpse clad in plate armor and riddled with arrows. Lever. Bolted to the floor in the middle of the room is a 4-foot-wide, 7-foot-long iron plate with a comb-shaped hole in it. An iron lever protrudes from the hole.</p><p>The remains in the southwest cell are those of a female orog who was captured by Arcturia and stripped of her weapons. The hobgoblins found her, shot her full of arrows through the bars, and left her corpse to rot.</p><p>The iron lever operates the mechanism that raises and lowers the portcullises by sliding it along the combshaped hole in the floor plate. Depending on how the lever is positioned, it can be used to raise any of the portcullises one at a time, or to lower all the portcullises into place.</p><p>The portcullises are impervious to weapon damage. The gaps between the bars are 4 inches wide. Closed portcullises are locked in place; forcing one upward requires a successful DC 26 Strength (Athletics) check.</p></div>

The statue stands atop a 3-foot-high stone base. The statue clutches a stone wand and points it toward the floor.</p><p>The statue represents Arcturia and is neither magical nor animate. The statue's wand points in the direction of the polymorph trap that is set before it (see "Polymorph Traps," page 180).

Pressing this button causes two keys tucked under Halaster's robes to clatter onto the floor around the statue's base. Each key is a fiat, 6-inch-long piece of mithral worked into a curious shape.</p><p>The first key is shaped like an F, the second like a V with a small loop at the bottom.

The head of the southern statue has broken off and lies on the floor nearby.</p><p>This cast-iron tankard once hung from the ceiling by iron chains and is big enough for four dwarves to crawl inside.

The 30-foot-high room is warm and contains the following features: Fire Giant. In the middle of the room, a male fire giant uses a massive hammer and anvil to pound a heated iron fragment into a rounded shape. Fire Beetles. Resting on the floor next to the oversized anvil is an iron cage containing fifteen brightly glowing giant fire beetles. (The giant uses the cage as a lantern.) Iron Pieces. Wings to the west and east contain pieces of sculpted iron of all shapes and sizes.</p><p>The giant, Hrossk, is hostile toward adventurers. He keeps his greatsword close at hand and hurls large metal cogs instead of rocks. Combat in this room can be heard by the fire giants in area 12, who investigate at once if a fight breaks out.</p><p>Hrossk's job is to recast hot iron into body parts for the giant construct in area 15. Without Hrossk, Emberosa lacks the metalsmithing skills needed to finish work on Mecha-Halaster. Hrossk is currently crafting a piece of what will become one of the construct's eyes. </p></div>

The curved ceilings in these chambers are 20 feet high.</p><p>Three fire giants (two females named Dralkana and Ingritt and a male named Yarshoss) are stationed here, one at each forge. Their job is to melt down fragments of scrap iron so that Hrossk, the fire giant metalsmith in area 11, can reshape them for the construct in area lS. It' s tedious work, and the fire giants are restless and spoiling for a fight.</p><p>The fires in the forges are conjured from the Elemental Plane of Fire.

It can't speak, and its movement is limited to harmless flapping. It can't use its Antimagic Cone trait or take any actions or reactions. Xebekal can be contacted with telepathy.

Giant Construct. In the middle of the room, lying on its back on the stone-tiled floor, is a 100-foot-tall figure made of molded iron, its feet pointing toward the double door to the south. The construct is missing its head, and there are gaps in its outer shell through which the construct's inner supports and mechanisms can be glimpsed. Emberosa. This female fire giant has 221 hit points and the innate magical ability to hurl fire at will (as the fire giant's Rock attack option, except it deals fire damage). She stands on the construct's chest, 20 feet above the floor. Flitting around her are her sidekicks, three smoke mephits. Pit. At the north end of the room is a 20-foot-deep pit with a dusty stone sarcophagus at the bottom.</p><p>Emberosa is inspecting the work of her fellow fire giants and doesn't want to be disturbed. To say she has a temper would be an understatement. If intruders enter the hall, she tries to make quick work of them while her mephits taunt the new arrivals mercilessly.

The box has a hinged lid and radiates an aura of transmutation magic under the scrutiny of a detect magic spell. When a Tiny beast small enough to fit in the box (such as a rat or a lizard) is placed inside and the lid is closed tightly, the box magically transforms it into some other Tiny beast (your choice) unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw.

It shacked up with Doomcrown and has been trying to convince him to reform. The hobgoblin has proven to be stubbornly, irredeemably evil, but their lengthy telepathic contact has caused Doomcrown to exhibit odd traits, including a subconscious need to recreate the ftumph's home-the Underdark-out of building blocks.

The chamber has the following features:</p><p>Plated Walls. At the end of a short hallway is a 20-foothigh domed chamber with seven narrow alcoves. Every surface is covered with gleaming mithral plates. Each alcove is brightly lit by the yellow glow of a small crystal dome embedded in its 8-foot-high ceiling. Key Shapes. Set into the mithral-plated walls between the alcoves are six key-shaped indentations at chest height. Each indentation is 6 inches long.</p><p>Each alcove is 8 feet tall and 4 feet deep, and narrows in width from 3 feet to 1 foot. A detect magic spell reveals a strong aura of abjuration magic engulfing each alcove, which is just spacious enough to accommodate a single Medium creature. The crystal dome in the ceiling is the source of the alcove's magic, and destroying its globe renders an alcove dark and powerless. Each dome has AC 11, a damage threshold of 10, 1 hit point, and immunity to acid, fire, poison, and psychic damage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>USING THE MrTHRAL KEYS</head><p>Six mithral keys are required to activate the chamber.

When the six keys (located in areas 7, 10, 13b, 27, and 39a) are placed in their corresponding indentations, a magic mouth spell counts down from 20 seconds (in Common). At the end of the countdown, there is an ear-splitting whine, and a powerful spell deals 150 force damage to every creature The alcove contains a stone statue that lacks fine features, resembling a blank-faced humanoid. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the statue, which alters its form to mimic the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid that touches it.

It does, however, ask them to set it free by breaking the seal outside the room. If the characters do so, the rakshasa turns invisible and makes its way out of Undermountain with the goal of working all manner of evil in Waterdeep-but not before telling the heroes where they can find Arcturia's spellbook (area 40b) and phylactery (area 40c), as well as the command word to reveal the bookshelves in area 40b. It also gives them a flat, 6-inch-long mithral key shaped like a Y, and tells them it's one of six keys required to activate the weapon of mass disintegration in area 37. Alussiarr doesn't know where the other five keys are kept.</p><p>If the characters haggle with the rakshasa, it also vows to provide up to three additional pieces of useful information in exchange for its freedom, such as the way to level 15.

The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes,'' page 12). • A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 11 on level 17, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there. The dwarf statue is inseparable from its base, and its base is inseparable from the floor. If anyone other than Arcturia opens the secret door, the statue transforms into a 6-inch-thick wall of stone that bisects the room from east to west, creating separate chambers to the north and south.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NETHERSKULL THE DEATH TYRANT</head><p>Many years ago, a beholder floated up from the Underdark and infiltrated Undermountain. After carving out a lair for itself, the beholder dreamed itself into undeath, becoming a death tyrant called Netherskull.</p><p>When Halas ter and Netherskull met in battle, the wizard emerged triumphant, but he couldn't bring himself to destroy such a formidable dungeon guardian. Instead, Halaster agreed to let Netherskull remain the undisputed lord of this level on the condition that it permit Halaster to tinker with and maintain the level's traps, as well as add a magical, mean-spirited announcer that taunts visitors as they blunder from one room to another (see "Halaster's Play-by-Play," page 194).</p></div>

The githzerai wait patiently to see the outcome of the Seadeeps conflict but stand ready to assist should the githyanki need help. The leader of this githzerai band, Yrlakka, is a member of the Sha'sal Khou, a faction of renegade githyanki and githzerai who seek to reunify the gith races. By helping the githyanki defeat a common foe, Yrlakka hopes to demonstrate the merits of a single unified gith race-not only to the evil githyanki, but also to the younger githzerai zerths who follow him. Yrlakka is concerned because his most headstrong pupil, a githzerai named Ezria, has disappeared. He fears (correctly) that Ezria was captured by the githyanki on level 16 while trying to find weak spots in their defenses. </p></div>

Each cover is carved to resemble the floor surrounding the pit. A character who has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 17 or higher recognizes the trapped section of floor as the cover of a pit. A character can also search the floor for traps, detecting the pit with a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check. Once a pit is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit's cover and the surrounding floor to prevent the cover from opening. The cover can also be held in place using an arcane Jock spell or similar magic.</p><p>When a weight of 25 pounds or more is placed on the cover, it swings downward (as long as it hasn't been prevented from opening) and remains open until Halaster happens by and decides to close it. Any creature or object on the cover when it swings open falls into the pit below. The pit's depth and other hazards vary by location, as described in the location's description. Regardless of a pit's depth, its walls are too smooth for characters to climb without the aid of climbing gear, magic, or the Spider Climb trait (or a similar ability).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TELEPORT TRAPS</head><p>Teleport traps are at the locations marked T on the map. A teleport trap is a magical effect usually cast on a 10-foot-square section of floor, set to trigger whenever a creature enters the trap's space. The trap extends all the way to the ceiling of the space that contains it. A teleport trap is invisible to the senses, and a permanent Nystul's magic aura spell prevents divination spells such as detect magic from revealing the trap's presence. A successful dispel magic spell (DC 18) cast on the trapped section of floor destroys the trap.</p><p>A creature that enters the trap's space is teleported along with any objects it is wearing or carrying to another teleport trap (or the nearest unoccupied space). There is no saving throw to resist the teleportation effect, and the destination varies from trap to trap. Once a creature has been teleported in this way, it is unaffected by teleport traps on this level for 1 hour.</p><p>When a creature is teleported by a trap, Halaster's booming voice shouts "Teleported!" in Common. The magical voice originates at the point of departure and the point of arrival, and it is audible in both locations out to a range of 100 feet.</p><p>Some teleport traps have additional effects, as described in their encounter locations.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_45">Halaster's disembodied voice magically chimes in with  play-by-play commentary. The effect can't be dispelled, and  its exact point of origin can't be ascertained. The play-by•  play can be silenced for good by destroying the source in  area 30b or by defeating the death tyrant Netherskull.  Improvise the play-by-play as you see fit. The commen•  tary tends to be sarcastic, biting, and demoralizing. A few  examples of what the disembodied voice might say are  provided below:</ref> When a character misses with a melee attack roll: "Swing and a miss!" When a character misses with a ranged attack roll:</p><p>"Missed that one by a mi le!" When a character takes da mage: "Ouch, that' ll leave a mark!" When the characters kill a monster: "Score one for the underdogs!" When the party cleric drops to 0 hit points: "The cleric is down! Stick a fork in it-this party's done!"</p><p>Splitting the Party. Teleport traps are designed to split the party-a situation that can challenge any DM. To ensure that every member of a split party gets attention, think of yourself as a film editor cutting scenes in a movie. Jump from one group of characters to the next while spending no more than a few minutes with any given group or individual. Tense moments are great times to "cut" from one group to another-don't be afraid to leave them hanging!</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPLO RI N G THIS L EVEL</head><p>The following encounter locations are keyed to map 15. The most distinguishing feature of the level is a gaping chasm that borders several dungeon corridors and chambers (see area 40 for details).</p><p>The Obstacle Course is mostly devoid of furnishings, since the level was designed explicitly to dispose of intruders in an efficient yet entertaining manner.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">ON Yo uR MARK! GET SET! G o !</head><p>A broad set of stairs descend to a large chamber with the following features:</p><p>Pillars. Four stone pillars support a 35-foot-high, vaulted ceiling strung with cobwebs. When one or more humanoids approach within 30 feet of the northeast pillar, a magic mouth spell activates, forming a stone mouth on the pillar. Statues. Tunnel exits to the north and south are flanked by 12-foot-tall stone statues of Halaster Blackcloak, depicted as a bearded, scowling old wizard wearing a robe covered with lidless eyes and clutching a stout scepter with a red dragon's head at each end. Mine Ca r ts. Two mine carts made of corroded iron stand near a tunnel exit in the east wall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HALASTER STATUES</head><p>These statues can't be moved, knocked over, or damaged in any way. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around each one. The axles, wheels, and brake handles of the mine carts are rusted in place. A prestidigitation cantrip or similar magic can free the mechanisms and render a mine cart functional for the spell's duration, but it still squeals loudly when rolled across the floor.</p><p>The characters are under no compulsion to heed Halaster's magic mouth spell. Any items they place in the carts and leave there are safe for 24 hours. After that, all unattended objects in the carts disappeartaken by Halaster to area 5 on level 23. Characters can find the missing items waiting for them there.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COVERED PIT</head><p>This 40-foot-deep hidden pit (see "Covered Pits," page 194) is located between the two northernmost statues. Halaster has cast a glyph of warding spell at the bottom of the pit, set to trigger a fireball spell (save DC 22) when a creature lands on the pit floor. The fireball is created using a 7th-level spell slot, engulfs all creatures in the pit, and deals 42 (12d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures in the pit have disadvantage on the saving throw, as there's precious little space to maneuver.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TELEPORT TRAP</head><p>Halaster has placed a teleport trap (see "Teleport Traps," page 194) between the two southern statues. A creature teleported by this trap arrives at a location determined by rolling a d20 and consulting the following <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">table:   d20</ref> Teleport Destination 1-12 The teleport trap in area 10 13-18 The teleport trap in area 19 19-20 The teleport trap in area 40c</p><p>Additional Effect: Elder Rune. The first time a creature triggers this teleport trap, an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12) appears in the air between the two southern statues a split second after the creature disappears, and at the same moment a booming voice shouts, "Teleported!" Draw a card from the Elder Runes Deck (see appendix B) to determine which rune appears. This rune targets all creatures within 60 feet of it with the same effect (bane or boon, determined randomly).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">CAUGHT IN THE TENTACLES</head><p>Ceilings. The central portion of this chamber has a domed ceiling 20 feet high. Wings to the east and west have 15-foot-high arched ceilings. Crevasse. Orange light and intense heat spill from a crevasse that splits the room nearly in two. (The source of the light is a river of lava 30 feet below, which widens toward the southeast, originating in area 40d.) Statues. Two life-size iron statues of mind flayers sit in opposite corners of the central chamber, facing one another with their tentacles outstretched.</p><p>Halaster placed the mind flayer statues here and trapped them. A detect magic spell reveals auras of abjuration and evocation magic around each one. It doesn't require an ability check to realize that a humanoid head would fit nicely inside each mind flayer's tentacles.</p><p>Any humanoid that passes between the statues must succeed on a DC 22 Intelligence saving throw or be charmed by the statues for 1 minute. The charmed creature must use all of its movement on its turn to move toward the nearest statue and stick its head between the tentacles. (A Small humanoid must climb the front of the statue to do so.) Only one creature at a time can place its head between the tentacles. A humanoid that places its head between the tentacles is no longer charmed but is stunned and remains so until another creature separates it from the statue or until the statue is destroyed. </p></div>

The statue holds five gold-painted stone coins in its outstretched hand. Close inspection reveals that one of the coins is loose and can be removed from the statue's hand. Engraved on each side of the loose coin is Halaster's rune. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around the coin, and an identify spell or similar magic reveals its magical property.</p><p>When an elder rune triggers within 60 feet of the creature that possesses the coin, the creature can use its reaction and the coin to change the elder rune's bane effect into a boon effect, or vice versa. After the coin is used once, it disappears in a flas h, accompanied by Halaster's booming laugh.</p></div>

A winch on the north wall of the chamber ra ises and Jowers both portcullises simultaneously, but it's beyond the reach of characters standing outside the room. A mage hand cantrip or an unseen servant spell cannot exert enough force to turn the winch, but a telekinesis spell does. A character can also circumvent one or both portcullises using a spell s uch as misty step or gaseous form. Any creature that touches either portcullis or passes between its electrified bars takes 22 (4d10) lightning damage, or 44 (8d10) lightning damage ifthe creature is made of ferrous metal or wearing metal armor.</p></div>

This rune targets all creatures in the room with the same effect (bane or boon, determined randomly). If Hal aster's personal rune is indicated, an additional effect occurs: the pillars flanking the doorway shoot multicolored rays from their eyes, and each creature in the room becomes the target of a prismatic spray spell (save DC 22).

So gloomy a creature was he that if Lorlynn can recover and animate his corpse, it will be as though he never died.</p><p>Lorlynn wears a tattered gray spider silk robe and cowl that, coupled with her gaunt features, makes her appear distinctly banshee-like. She abhors the company of other humanoids except her brother. She is in a relaxing trance when the characters first arrive. Normally indifferent toward adventurers, she turns hostile if she finds that the characters have her brother's spellbook and refuse to surrender it to her. If her skeletons are turned or destroyed and she is reduced to half her hit points or fewer, Lorlynn offers information in exchange for her life.

A crumbling ledge overlooks a great chasm brightly lit by a bubbling pool of lava 30 feet below. Visible from this location is a spectral bridge that s pans the chasm (see area 16). Debris. What's left of the floor is strewn with broken, corroded fragments of dwarf-sized chain mail and plate armor. Arch. Embedded in the middle of the south wall is a stone arch made up of one hundred s tone jigsaw pieces. This arch is one of Halaster's magic gates (see "Gates," page 12).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARCH G ATE TO LEVEL 20</head><p>Each of the arch's one hundred jigsaw pieces weighs 10 pounds. The rules of this gate are as follows:</p><p>• Only one piece of the arch can be removed at any given time. A detect magic spell reveals that one of the pieces (determined randomly) is magical. When that piece is removed from the arch, it disappears, and the gate opens for 1 minute. When the gate closes, the piece removed from the arch magically reappears in its proper place, and a different piece becomes magical and must be removed to reopen the gate. • If a wrong piece is removed from the arch, an adult white dragon magically appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the arch and attacks any creature it can see. The dragon disappears when it is slain or after 1 minute. When the dragon disappears, the piece that was removed from the arch magically reappears in its previous place. • Characters must be at least 16th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12). • A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 9b on level 20, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there. Whenever a creature on the bridge crosses the midpoint of the span, there is a 25 percent chance that the lava pool below spouts a fireball that explodes at a point centered on that creature. The effect is that of a fireball spell (save DC 19) cast using a 7th-level spell slot. It deals 42 (12d6) fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p></div>

Using psionics, they hide themselves from the scrying eyes of Halaster. They a lso avoid Netherskull.</p><p>The githzerai leader, Yrlakka, is a father figure to the others and serves as their mentor. They attack mind flayers and their thralls on sight, but all other creatures are treated with cautious respect until they prove themselves undeserving of such consideration.</p><p>All rooms and corridors in this part of the dungeon have flat, 10-foot-high ceilings. Characters who hold bright light sources in this room or make a lot of noise alert the githzerai in area 24c, who remain where they are but can't be surprised. Since they can't avoid the trap, the githzerai steer clear of area 24d and the hallway that leads to it unless they need to use the trap to escape a greater danger.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>24B. RESTING CHAMBER</head><p>The githzerai use this chamber to sleep and meditate. Five bedrolls are laid out on the dusty floor, one for each githzerai (including the missing zerth).</p></div>

The room's features are as follows:</p><p>Gitbzerai. Four githzerai zerths are having a hushed conversation in the middle of the room, speaking Gith. They stop talking and ready themselves for combat if they detect intruders. Arch. A stone arch is embedded in the middle of the south wall. Carved into the arch's keystone is an image of a six-fingered gauntlet.</p><p>The zerths include Yrlakka, the group's leader, and three of his pupils: two female githzerai named Azal and Vond, and a male named Rishindar. Yrlakka's primary concern is the safe return of his missing pupil, Ezria, who he believes was captured while scouting the githyanki forces on level 16. If the characters agree to find Ezria, Yrlakka and his remaining pupils tag along unless the characters would rather complete the quest by themselves. If Ezria is rescued and reunited with his companions, Yrlakka rewards the characters with the wand in his possession (see "Treasure" below).</p><p>If the characters aren't interested in a iding the githzerai but request help getting through the Obstacle Course, Yrlakka tells them that the level is rigged with many traps and guarded by a death tyrant.</p><p>Arch Gate to Level 17. The arch is one of Halaster's magical gates (see "Gates," page 12). This gate's rules are as follows:</p><p>• The gate opens for 1 minute if a creature touches the arch with a six-fingered gauntlet (one can be found in area 14b). • Characters must be 14th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12). A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 7a on level 17, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.</p><p>The githzerai have correctly deduced that a six-fingered gauntlet is required to activate the gate but don't know where to find such an item. </p></div>

(The sarcophagus contains a vampire.) Floating above the vessel is a magic rune that glows as bright as a candle flame.</p><p>A character who understands Dwarvish recognizes the glowing, magical rune as a dwarven symbol of death (identical to the one inscribed on the door to area 14a). The first time a creature crosses from one side of the pit to the other, the rune disappears and imprints itself as a death mark on a visible portion of the creature's face or body. The mark disappears when its bearer dies or when the vampire is destroyed. Only a wish spell or a deity can remove a death mark otherwise.</p><p>The sarcophagus at the bottom of the pit is a 2,000-pound chunk of hollowed-out alabaster. Zorak Lightdrinker, a vampire in mist form, is trapped inside. When the death mark is imprinted on a creature, the sarcophagus crumbles to dust and Zorak is released. The sarcophagus is otherwise indestructible.</p><p>A geas spell cast by Ha laster compels Zorak to hunt down and destroy the creature bearing the death mark, singling out that target above all others.

UNDERBREW IN CHAINS</head><p>Affixed to the back wall of the western alcove is a stoneframed painting of a scarred male dwarf wearing black plate armor. He is bound by heavy iron chains and shackles anchored to the floor of a dreary dungeon cell. The painting is 3Y2 feet wide by 7 feet tall.</p><p>Thanks to a permanent Nystul's magic aura spell cast on the painting, a detect magic spell does not reveal that the painting is magical. It is a magical prison that can hold one humanoid creature at a time. The first humanoid creature that approaches within 5 feet of the painting must succeed on a DC 22 Charisma saving throw or be magically pulled into it, switching places with the dwarf currently trapped inside (see below). A humanoid drawn into the painting finds itself chained in an extradimensional cell 10 feet on a s ide. While trapped in the cell, the creature is paralyzed. The painting has AC 11, 4 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Destroying it frees the trapped creature, which appears in the closest unoccupied space adjacent to the painting.</p><p>Thwad Underbrew. The dwarf in the painting is a beard-stroking villain named Thwad Underbrew, a former champion of Gorm Gulthyn (the dwarven god of vigilance) who long ago set out to rid Undermountain of the evil that is Halaster Blackcloak. Ha laster defeated Underbrew but offered to spare the dwarf's life if he vowed to serve the Mad Mage as an enforcer, ridding the dungeon of other invaders. Unwilling to face his own mortal end, Underbrew made this vow and convinced himself over time that the executions he performed were acts of mercy, because those he killed would never be forced to turn against their beliefs as he had. In time, these acts stopped weighing on Underbrew's conscience. In fact, the dwarf began to enjoy his grisly work.</p><p>Thwad Underbrew is a shield dwarf champion (see appendix A), with these changes:</p><p>• Underbrew is neutral evil.</p><p>• Instead of a greatsword, he wields a maul (which deals bludgeoning damage instead of s lashing damage). • He has these racial traits: He speaks Common and Dwarvish.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="30.">H AL ASTER'S H AN DIWORK -----</head><p>The challenges that await adventurers in these areas can be directly attributed to the Mad Mage. To flatter Netherskull, Halaster assigned a would-be apprentice to chronicle the death tyrant's history in a series of journals. This biographer is a skittish, ill-bred, and unkempt male human in his thirties named Kavil Mereshanter. Kavil is a mage, with these changes:</p><p>• Kavil is neutral evil.</p><p>• He speaks Dwarvish, Common, Giant, and Undercommon.</p><p>Kavil was denied admittance to Dweomercore {level 9), and Halaster robbed him of his spellbook. The Mad Mage has promised to return the book once Kavil completes his work. (In fact, Halaster has misplaced the spellbook, though Kavil is unaware of this.)</p><p>As Netherskull's appointed biographer, Kavil is expected to earn the death tyrant's trust, but Netherskull trusts no wizard, and has been reluctant to grant interviews. Kavil has instead filled one journal after another with his own narrative concoctions and self-pitying asides. The biography is a mostly fictionalized, somewhat sensationalized version of Netherskull's life, death, and undeath. Kavil knows that anyone who reads this drivel won't be fooled, but he's hoping the deluge of words will impress Halaster while simultaneously discouraging close examination of the work.</p><p>Kavil won't start a fight, but he s ides with the nycaloths if a battle erupts, which is likely since the fiends have orders to slay intruders. If reduced to 33 hit points or fewer, Kavil switches sides and offers information in exchange for his life. He knows one random Undermountain secret, determined by drawing a card from the Secrets Deck (see appendix C), as well as a secret way into Netherskull's lair (see a rea 39b). Kavil isn't aware of the secret door that leads to area 30b.</p><p>Characters who spend at least 10 minutes poring over Kavil's journal can piece together bits of Netherskull's history and, with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight} check, separate out Kavil's gibberish to learn the following truths:</p><p>• The beholder's true name is unknown. It changed its name to Netherskull after becoming a death tyrant. • Netherskull has slain countless interlopers, none more deserving of death than a pompous human paladin named Fidelio, who wept bitter tears before his disintegration. • The gate opens for 1 minute when a real or illusory dragon touches the arch. An a rtistic rendering of a dragon, such as a dragon-shaped figurine or a drawing of a dragon, also opens the gate. • Characters must be at least 15th level or higher to pass through this gate (see ''.Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12). • A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 16 on level 18, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.</p><p>Gong. A detect magic s pell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around the gong. If the gong is struck with the mallet, three items appear on the floor before it: a small clay bowl filled with bland, edible food (hunks of bread and cheese, strips of meat, and dried nuts); an empty tin cup; and a glass carafe containing 1 gallon of water. The items disappear a fter 1 hour. Removing any of these items from the room also causes them to vanish. Once it is used to summon food and water, the gong can't do so again until the next dawn.

The surface of the cube facing the secret door bears Halaster's fleshy, grimacing visage.</p><p>Disturbing the cube causes it to sprout spindly arms, legs, and wings. It then fights until destroyed. It has the statistics of a quadr one, with these changes:</p><p>• The cube is chaotic evil.</p><p>• It s peaks Common and is the source of Halaster's play-by-play (see "Halaster's Play-by-Play," page 194). • Whenever it would normally make a shortbow attack, it instead hurls a magic dart at a target it can see up to 60 feet away from it. Each dart hits its target automatically (no attack roll required) for 5 (2d4) force damage.</p><p>As the cube attacks, it continues its play-by-play routine, commentating its battle with the adventurers. Destroying the cube ends the play-by-play throughout the Obstacle Course.</p><p>Hidden K ey. A secret compartment is hidden atop the hexagonal plinth.

DEATH TYRANT</head><p>All doors leading to this area are I-foot-thick, 7-foot-diameter adamantine disks molded to look like concentric rings of bones with a leering human skull at the center. The skull's nose cavity contains an adamantine keyhole. When one of Halaster's bone keys (see areas 19 and 30b) is inserted into the lock and turned 90 degrees clockwise, four bolt locks slide back from the surrounding walls, and the door swings inward on adamantine hinges. The door remains open until it is closed, and the key can be removed at any time. Without the proper key, it takes four separate knock spells to open one of these doors, each spell causing one bolt to slide back. The doors are otherwise impregnable.</p><p>There is no keyhole on the inside of the doors. Instead, each door has an adamantine wheel in the middle of it that must be turned counterclockwise to slide back the bolts. This wheel can also be used as a handle to pull the heavy door open.

Such a vessel might be crewed by githyanki, gnomes, or some other spacefaring race.</p><p>About once a year, a githyanki-crewed astral ship delivers young githyanki to the creche. A githyanki astral ship doesn't travel through space but rather shifts in and out of the Astral Plane, appearing literally out of nowhere next to the asteroid's dock and disappearing back into the s ilvery void once its delivery is complete. If the githyanki discover that Creche K'liir has fallen, they retreat to the Astral Plane and return in short order with an overwhelming force to recapture the asteroid.</p><p>Halaster cares more about the Crystal Labyrinth than he does about Stardock. Suddenly unhappy with the "renovations" the githyanki have made, the Mad Mage might assert his control over the labyrinth and reshape it to suit his whims.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MIN D FLAYERS</head><p>Deep in the Underdark, a githyanki vanguard force attacked a large colony of mind flayers controlled by an elder brain. Fearing the colony's destruction, the elder brain instructed its most loyal vassal, an ulitharid called Extremiton, to establish a splinter colony somewhere safe from githyanki incursions. Extremiton made its way to Undermountain with a group of mind flayers, laid claim to level 17 of the dungeon, and began fortifying it against attacks from the githyanki and others. The dungeon's proximity to Waterdeep guaranteed the mind fl ayers a limitless supply of brains to feed on, while Undermountain's existing defenses offered an unprecedented level of security.</p></div>

Having recently secured the nearby Crystal Labyrinth (level 16), the githyanki now wage war against the mind flayers in Seadeeps. Uncertainty about its own future has forced Extremiton to hold off on transforming into an elder brain. Instead, it is focused on defending the colony and destroying its githyanki neighbors. With only a dozen mind flayers remaining under its rule, Extremiton has resorted to breeding a neothelid (see appendix A) and plans to set it loose in the Crystal Labyrinth to finally wipe out the githyanki force.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSIPODS</head><p>A psipod is a magic device that connects the mind of an unconscious humanoid to the m ind of the ulitharid in area 12g. The psychic residue that coats each psipod is a byproduct of this connection. The residue is sticky and foul-smelling, but harmless. It dissolves after a few hours.</p><p>Any creature that enters a psipod's bronze cylinder must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious, lulled into that state by a soothing psionic vibration that the ulitharid produces. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw must repeat it at the end of each of its turns unit it exits the cylinder.</p><p>While in a psipod, an unconscious creature finds itself drawn into a simulated reality created by the ulitharid (see the "Alterdeep" sidebar) and can survive in this state for the remainder of its natural life, its mind and body nourished by the psipod's psychic energy. If the psipod is shut down, or if the unconscious creature is removed from it, the creature can repeat the DC 17 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, waking on a success. The creature also awakens if it takes damage in the real world, but not if it takes damage in the Waterdeep simulation.</p><p>A psipod shuts down if it is disabled or destroyed. To disable a psipod, a creature must disconnect three of the eight copper wires connecting it to the metal panels in the floor. The mind flayers' schematic pads identify which three wires to disconnect on each psipod. (The combination of wires varies from one psipod to another.) If wires are torn out at random, roll a d8 three times (rerolling duplicate results) to determine which three wires shut down that particular psipod, then roll a d8 for each wire that is disconnected to see if it's one of the correct ones. Disconnecting a wrong wire triggers a magical surge that targets all creatures within 5 feet of the psipod except the one inside it. A targeted creature must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A magical surge from one psipod has no effect on the others.</p><p>All the psipods shut down if the ulitharid dies or leaves the crystal throne in area 12g. Each psipod is a  <ref type="table" target="#tab_75">Waterdeep-or rather, an alternate version  ofWaterdeep created by Extremiton.

All were abducted from Waterdeep. Apply racial traits to them as warranted, and remember that dwarves, elves, and tieflings have darkvision.</p><p>The ninth humanoid is Selphorn Amcathra (NE male Tethyrian human noble). A resident of the town of Amphail, he was abducted after attending the funeral of a cousin in Waterdeep. Selphorn promises a reward of 500 gp for his safe return to the City of Splendors and makes good on his promise, but he puts his self-interest above all other concerns.

The walls of force also disappear if the mind flayers are pulled away from the pedestal-though the walls reappear if contact is reestablished, as long as the diamond is still floating in place.

Characters might try luring it to another level of Undermountain, where it can wreak even more havoc. If the neothelid becomes too great a nuisance, Halaster takes strides to either destroy or contain it.</p><p>Killing Extremiton completes a quest (see "Uncover the Telepathic Spy," page 10). Deprived of their leader, the surviving illithids disappear into other corners of Undermountain or return to the Underdark. With the illithids gone, the githyanki move to secure the level with reinforcements from level 16-assuming there are any githyanki left. If the githyanki are wiped out and Extremiton is allowed to live, it eventually turns itself into an elder brain, which attracts more illithids to the colony. In addition, the illithids continue to capture people from Waterdeep for their Alterdeep simulation, which grows more intricate and nuanced every day.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_75">Although none  of these adventurers succeeded, they winnowed down  Vanrak's army to the point where he could no longer  threaten the city.

The Waterdavian family is currently overseen by the once shrewd but now senile Lady Wylynd Moonstar, a venerable human noblewoman who, by last estimate, is well over a century old. Although she has no children of her own, Wylynd is surrounded by distant relatives, including a savvy half-drow grandnephew named Helion Moonstar, whom she has chosen to be her heir. The family's business interests lie in cartography and exploration, and Wylynd has been known to fund expeditions to Undermountain from time to time for reasons she prefers to keep to herself.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>KERESTA DELVINGSTONE</head><p>Keresta Delvingstone grew up in the streets of Waterdeep and is no stranger to hardship. Hoping to make a better life for herself, she became an adventurer and sought fame and fortune in Undermountain. Keresta met her end in the lair of a vampire and became a vampire spawn under its command.</p><p>After Vanrak destroyed the vampire and conquered its lair, he took Keresta under his wing. Consumed by darkness and loss, Keresta was drawn to Shar like a moth to a flame and rose to become a vampire cleric of the evil god. She now leads Shar's debased cult in Vanrakdoom and intends to send the group on a mission to destroy the Spires of the Morning, the temple of Lathander (god of birth and renewal) in Waterdeep. She also has her sights set on destroying the House of the Moon- . She has the following cleric spells prepared:</p><p>Cantrips (at will): guidance, mending, resistance, thaumaturgy 1st level (4 slots): bane, command, inflict wounds, ray of sickness 2nd level (3 slots): blindness/deafness, ray of enfeeblement, spiritual weapon 3rd level (3 slots): animate dead, bestow curse, dispel magic, spirit guardians 4th level (3 slots): blight, death ward, divination 5th level (1 slot): antilife shell, destructive wave</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REGIONAL EFFECTS</head><p>Vanrakdoom is Keresta's lair, and the following regional effects are noticeable throughout it:</p><p>• Fog creeps into areas of dim light or darkness. It vanishes when light is brought to bear on it but reappears when the light passes. A permanent fog hangs in some areas regardless of light, as noted in the descriptions of those areas. • Rats and bats are plentiful. In areas where they are not specifically mentioned, droppings and guano betray their presence, and they can be heard constantly scuttling and shrieking in the distant darkness.</p><p>If Keresta is destroyed, the fog disperses, and the rats and bats gradually die off until only a scattered few remain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>UMBRAXAKAR</head><p>The shadow dragon Umbraxakar used to be a lawful good bronze dragon named Glyster. Fond of assuming human form, Glyster was Vanrak Moonstar's friend and companion, remaining by the noble's side even after Vanrak's fall from grace. Glyster tried to turn Vanrak away from the worship of Shar, to no avail, and the dragon sank into despair. In this forlorn state, he allowed Shar's priests to transform him into a shadow dragon to better serve Vanrak in the battles to come. Thereafter, Glyster became known as Umbraxakar ("shadowborn" in Draconic).</p><p>The death knight and the shadow dragon fought side by side for many years, expanding their domain and then defending it against adventurers and other invaders. By this time, Umbraxakar had stopped caring about anything except his friendship with Vanrak. The friendship finally ended when Vanrak destroyed himself with a sun blade, leaving Umbraxakar and the remnants of Shar's wicked cult to fend for themselves.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VISIONS OF UMBRAXAKAR</head><p>As characters explore areas ofVanrakdoom, they experience magical visions of terrible things that the dragon experienced long ago. These visions, byproducts of Umbraxakar's despair, provide clues that can help free the dragon from his dark curse. A character does not ex-perience such visions within an antimagic field or while under the protection of a dispel evil or good spell.</p><p>Characters also encounter magical projections of Umbraxakar <ref type="table" target="#tab_75">. These shadowy images take the form of  harmless, dragon-shaped clouds of black fog. A projection that is targeted by a dispel magic spell or touched  by an antimagic field is destroyed instantly. It otherwise  cannot be har med.</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CULT OF SHAR</head><p>The cult of Shar in Vanrakdoom consists mainly of vampire spawn under the command of Keresta Delvingstone. Living cultists also find their way here from time to time, guided through Undermountain by the dark grace of Shar herself. Keresta turns the most promising acolytes into vampire spawn. Those deemed unworthy of Shar's blessing nouris h Keresta and her spawn with their blood, after which Umbraxakar devours the exsanguinated corpses.</p><p>Cultists are neutral evil huma ns who wear dusty gray robes over their armor.

In these areas, bright light is reduced to dim light, and dim light to darkness. In addition, all color has been drained from these areas, and a deathly stench hangs in the a ir. The walls are severely cracked, the floor tiles are buckled and broken in numerous places, and the ceilings have begun to sag as though they won't remain in place much longer.</p><p>Areas within the Shadowfell are no longer part of Undermountain and therefore aren't subject to its magical restrictions (see "Alterations to Magic," page 10).</p><p>The shadow dragon's despair can cause other areas of Vanrakdoom to slide in and out of the Shadowfell at irregular intervals-sometimes for a few seconds or minutes, sometimes for hours. Any such s hift happens at your discretion and lasts as long as you want. When a n area slides into the Shadowfell, all colors and lights within the area become muted as described above.</p></div>

With that, the vision ends. Treasure. The first character to receive this vision steps on a ring lying on the floor. Close examination reveals that the ring is the one from the dragon's vision: a polished coral band that glimmers with a rainbow of color. The ring is nonmagical and worth 250 gp. The stone arch is one of Halaster's magic gates (see "Gates," page 12). Its rules are as follows:</p><p>If a silence spell is cast so that the arch falls within the spell's area, the gate opens for 1 minute. Characters must be 9th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10).

A human cult fanatic engulfed in a swarm of r ats stands quietly in their midst.</p><p>The kneeling cultists are named Caradoc, Feldar, Hong, Khafra, Serenade, and Xandeval. They are chanting the following verse over and over in Common: "Darkness quench the sun. Darkness swallow the moon. We are nothing but the night."</p><p>Keresta Delvingstone is using the swarm of rats to test the cult fanatic, whose name is Jian. To pass the test, Jian must allow the rats to crawl over his body without fear or protest, or else they will devour him. Only by passing this test canJian qualify to become one of Keresta's vampire spawn.</p><p>The arrival of intruders prompts the cultists to take up arms and attack. Jian, however, does nothing while the rats swarm over him. If he takes damage,Jian panics and is swiftly devoured by the rats. If the swarm loses more than half its hit points, it scatters and flees. The vampire spawn, named Angelica and Yaveros, hiss at intruders and demand they leave at once, attacking those who disobey.

A stone arch set into the south wall is decorated with gold-inlaid images of dragons in flight. Carved into the wall above the arch are the following words in Draconic: "Only a dragon can unlock this gate." Fountains. Alcoves to the west and east contain stone fountains, each carved to look like a perched bronze dragon spouting water into an ornate stone basin.</p><p>The fountains are fed by an underground spring and flow with clean, cool water. The living inhabita nts of Vanrakdoom depend on this water for their survival.</p><p>A fountain's 4-foot-tall dragon sculpture can be broken off with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check and used to activate the arch gate in this room.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARCH GATE</head><p>The arch is one of Halaster's gates (see "Gates," page 12). Its rules are as follows:</p><p>• The gate opens for 1 minute when a real or illusory dragon touches the arch. An artistic rendering of a dragon, such as a dragon-shaped figurine or a drawing of a dragon, also opens the gate. • Characters must be 13th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12). • A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 30a on level 15, in the closest unoccupied space next to the similar gate located there.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="18.">SHADOW'S EDGE</head><p>Two tunnels converge on a 20-foot-high chamber that contains the following features:</p><p>Statues. Two 12-foot-tall obsidian statues stand atop 5-foot-high blocks of stone in alcoves, facing one another. Each statue depicts a faceless robed woman holding a silver thread taut between her outstretched hands. Shadow Curtain. A thin, translucent curtain of shadow stretches between the statues, rippling like black cloth in a light breeze. Locked Double Door. Beyond the shadowy curtain is a 12-foot-tall arched double door with an ornate carving of a bronze dragon above it, its wings forming the door frame. Draconic letters are carved into the floor in front of the double door.</p><p>A detect magic spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around each strand of silver thread. The threads can be cut only by a magic sword. Cutting a thread causes it to disappear but also causes an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12) to momentarily appear between the statue's hands. This elder rune specifically targets the creature that cut the thread. To determine which rune appears, draw a card from the Elder Runes Deck (see appendix B). The shadow curtain disappears when both silver threads are cut.</p><p>The rippling curtain of shadow that stretches between the two statues extends from fioor to ceiling and radiates a strong aura of necromantic magic under the scrutiny of a detect magic spell. The statues are flush with the walls behind them, so circumventing the curtain is not possible.</p><p>Any creature that moves through the curtain must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4dl0) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. </p></div>

All color has been drained from this hall, which greets visitors with the stench of death (see "Into the Shadowfell," page 233). The hall's other features are as follows:</p><p>Ceiling. The ceiling is arched and 30 feet high. Skulls and Bones. Old skulls and bones (the remains of dead adventurers and monsters) have been swept into alcoves along the hall's southern stretch. Vision. Any character who opens a door leading west or east experiences one of the shadow dragon's visions.</p><p>If the bones are disturbed, a giant spectral mouth with fangs appears, floating 10 feet in front of the double door to the south. It recites the following verse in Common before disappearing:</p><p>Welcome to Umbraxakar's lair. A dragon held in the grip of despair Conjures memories of his departed friend: Upon sunlight's blade, he met his end.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DRAGON'S V ISION</head><p>In this vision, the character is engaged in hand-to-hand combat with a man wearing a mithral chain shirt (Lord Vanrak Moonstar). The brawl ends when the man is knocked to the floor, stumbles to his feet, draws the bronzed hilt of a sun blade that suddenly burns with radiance, and says, "Remember this? Your gift to me? Challenge me again, and I'll carve out that big heart of yours and eat it!" The viewer's perspective changes as the character transforms into a bronze dragon and says in Common, "Vanrak! I am your friend. Listen to me. She's using the pain of your father's death to lead you down the darkest of all paths. For the love of SeJUne, do not follow her!" With that, the vision ends. A character who examines the rug and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices that it bears a large, faded crest of a silver crescent moon and four silver stars set against a field of royal blue. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (History) check reveals that the crest belongs to the Moonstar family of Waterdeep, presided over by the venerable Lady Wylynd Moonstar.</p></div>

Because of the detritus, the floor of the room is difficult terrain. In this vision, the character is in the presence ofVanrak Moonstar, a death knight wearing a mithral chain shirt and clutching a bladeless sword hilt. "This is not the fate either of us deserved," he says mournfully. "In darkness, we have lost our way." With that, he causes a blade of light to spring from the sword hilt and drives it down his own throat, reducing his skeletal form to dust. The blade is snuffed out, and all goes dark as the hilt clatters to the floor alongside the death knight's mithral chain shirt. The vision ends with a dragon's anguished roar.</p></div>

A human adventurer named Portia Dzuth is chained up to the north. Her armor and equipment lie in a heap to the south.</p><p>Portia Dzuth hails from Rashemen. She is the sole survivor of an adventuring party hired by Lady Wylynd Moonstar ofWaterdeep to find Umbraxakar the shadow dragon and transform him back into Glyster the bronze dragon, friend of House Moonstar. Portia thinks Umbraxakar's curse can be undone by ridding the dragon of its despair, but she has no idea how to accomplish this. She and her companions were captured less than a month ago, but Portia has lost track of time and believes she has been imprisoned in Vanrakdoom for much longer. The vampire spawn feed on Portia whenever blood is in short supply, and she has the bite marks to prove it. After each feeding, Keresta charms Portia to keep her calm and under control.</p><p>A character can free Portia from her shackles using the key in area 25a, or by picking the lock with thieves' tools and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. A character can also free Portia by snapping her chains with a successful DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check.</p><p>Portia sank into madness and despair after she was forced to watch Umbraxakar devour the corpses of her slain companions one by one. She stays close to her rescuers, serving as a loyal follower until she is safely out of Undermountain or until Keresta asks her to betray them. While fighting on the party's side, Portia claims an equal share of all XP gained. She is a champion (see appendix A), with these changes:</p><p>• Portia is lawful neutra l and speaks Common.</p><p>• She is magically charmed by Keresta and regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. This effect wears off in 12 hours unless Keresta charms her again. • She suffers from Shadowfell despair manifesting as unshakable dread. Until the despair ends, she has disadvantage on all saving throws and gains the following flaw: "I'm convinced that I'm going to die in Vanrakdoom." She can attempt to end her despair each time she finishes a long rest, doing so with a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. A calm emotions spell also ends her despair, as does any spell or other magical effect that removes a curse. The haughty Keresta welcomes the characters to their doom and promises them a swift death. If asked about Lord Vanrak Moonstar or Umbraxakar, Keresta laughs and says that Shar's darkness consumes all things in the end.</p><p>If reduced to 0 hit points, Keresta turns to mist and retreats to her resting place in area 31 (via area 30). In mist form, she can pass through the cracks under doors and blend in with the fog to become effectively invisible.</p><p>The abominable yeti and the vampire spawn fight to the death to protect Keresta, as does Portia Dzuth (see area 25b) if she is present and still charmed by Keresta. The squad of vampire spawn is composed of adventurers and cultists who have been turned into undead by Keresta. Their names are Aryk, Bartho, Callia, Gaston, Hector, Ilsuban, Nath, Rhylzar, and Rose.</p><p>The parchment on the table is a map ofWaterdeep, drained of color like everything else in this part of Vanra kdoom.

When Ezzat learned what Halaster was up to, the lich placed wards on the stalagmite tower to prevent constructs from assailing it. This countermove prompted Halaster to abandon his golems and stop making new ones.</p></div>

Then he set them loose on this level. Called Stonecloaks, these 10-foot-tall golems worship the Mad Mage as a god a nd regard the Runestone as his eye into their dark domain. The Stonecloaks don't like it that a lich has taken refuge in the stalagmite tower, but Ezzat's wards mean that there's little they can do about it.</p><p>Unless otherwise noted, a Stonecloak uses the stone golem statistics, with these changes:</p><p>• A Stonecloak has Intelligence and Charisma scores of9. • It understands the following languages but can't speak: Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, Infernal, and Undercommon.

This otherworldly cavern is 100 feet high, 1,200 feet long, and 800 feet wide. It has the following features:</p><p>Light. The cavern is lit by phosphorescent moss that grows on weird rock formations a long the walls. A dozen giant fire beetles that primarily feast on carrion dwell here, adding to the illumination. Fungi Forest. Half the cavern is a forest of towering zurkhwood, interspersed with barrelstalks, bluecaps, and trillimacs (see "Fungi," page 59). Lake. The other half of the cavern contains a 30-footdeep lake fed by three small waterfalls. Several small rocky islands rise out of the la ke, each holding a number of empty huts (an abandoned kuo-toa settlement).</p><p>The fungus forest and the underground lake are home to all kinds of subterranean wildlife, including bats, fish, and non-biting insects.

The cave's other features are as follows: The centipedes and the fire beetles share this delicate ecosystem with the myconids, serving to help control the growth of fungi in the caverns. The light from the fire beetles' carapaces is the cave's only illumination. These creatures are not under the myconids' control and fight only in self-defense.</p><p>The myconid sprouts form an inner ring 6 feet in diameter, and the adults are in a protective ring 10 feet in diameter around them. The myconids use their Rapport Spores action option to peacefully meld with one another.

The myconids offer to take visitors to their sovereign (area 4b) or escort them to the edge of their domain. The friendly fungus folk are blissfully unaware of the conflict happening outside their caverns, but they're afraid of the "rock giants" (Halaster's stone golems) and "rock demons" (gargoyles) that dwell in the caves around them.</p></div>

Its bioluminescent cap sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.</p><p>When not melding with its subjects, the myconid sovereign-named Floot-spends its time cultivating exotic mushrooms and crafting potions. Using its Rapport Spores action option to facilitate telepathic communication, Floot welcomes characters to its domain and offers them two potions as gifts (see "Treasure" below). Floot expects nothing in return, but if the characters are of a mind to reciprocate, the sovereign urges them to destroy any "rock demons" (gargoyles) they encounter, for the good of the myconid colony.</p><p>Treasure.

Someone has used a knife to scratch the following warning, in Dwarvish, into the east wall: "The Mad Mage watches us. The Runestone is his eye!"  <ref type="table" target="#tab_20">who descend to the floor find it jagged, uneven, and littered with the broken pieces of stone  golems (tossed into the chasm by the mad golem in area  2), four dead gargoyles in pieces, and the bones of a  dwarf (a miner who slipped and fell into the chasm over  a century ago)</ref>. The miner's pick lies near the bones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14.">THE RUNESTONE</head><p>The tip of the giant stalagmite at the center of area 13a is pierced by a large hole. Set within this hole is a 10-foot-diameter, circular lozenge of translucent white crystal called the Runestone. The crystal radiates bright blue-white light in a 120-foot radius and dim light for an additional 120 feet. Halaster's red-glowing rune floats inside it.</p><p>The Runestone is a Large object with AC 10; 90 hit points; immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons that aren't adamantine; and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Provided it has at least 1 hit point, the crystal can magically repair itself, regaining 10 (3d6) hit points each hour.</p><p>As an action, Halaster can establish a magical link with the Runestone from anywhere inside Undermountain, provided the crystal hasn't been destroyed. This link allows him to see, speak, and cast spells through the Runestone as though he were standing in its space. Spells he casts through the Runestone appear to originate from the rune lodged inside it. Halaster can end the link at any time (no action required).</p><p>While Halaster is linked to the Runestone, its light changes from blue-white to red-orange, and Halaster's rune turns from bright red to fluorescent purple. The brightness and extent of the light doesn't change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CAPTURING I PSES</head><p>Characters who lurk outside the stalagmite tower long enough might see Ezzat open the outer door to release his pseud odragon, lpses (see area 17). The lich stands in the open doorway while lpses hunts vermin and gathers up any Runestone fragments it finds in the surrounding cavern. Once t he pseudodragon has eaten and taken care of business, it returns to the tower. The outer door then shuts and locks as Ezzat and lpses retreat inside.</p><p>lpses has long been denied the taste of good food and simply can't resist an offering of fruit, candy, cheese, or some other delicacy. If the pseudodragon goes missing in the cavern, Ezzat locks up the tower and searches for it. Characters who capture lpses can hold the pseudodragon hostage and use it to wring information from Ezzat, as you determine. (See " Roleplaying Ezzat," page 262, for more information.)</p><p>In exchange for the pseudodragon's safe return, the lich also offers to t rade the potions in area 20. If the characters demand more, Ezzat throws in what he cla ims is a staff of frost. If that deal is done, the sentient staff (see area 16) reveals its true nature and attacks lpses's abductors as soon as the pseudodragon is safe. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STALAGMITE TOWER</head><p>The stalagmite tower at the center of the main cavern is 120 feet tall and has chambers hollowed out of the lower two-thirds of its height. Those hollowed-out areas have 3-foot-thick outer walls, 2-foot-thick inner walls, and 3-foot-thick floors, all hewn from solid rock. All ceilings in the tower are 20 feet high. The outer surface of the stalagmite has numerous footholds and ledges, and can be climbed with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.</p><p>The stalagmite tower is impervious to damage, as well as to magic that would alter its form (such as a stone shape spell) or create openings through it (such as a passwafl spell or a portable hole). A creature can exit the tower by using magic, but the tower prevents any creature from entering it in similar fashion. Spells such as dimension door or teleport thus can't be used to get inside the tower, nor can creatures be magically summoned inside it by anyone except Ezzat.</p><p>No constructs can approach within 10 feet of the stalagmite. Such creatures encounter what feels like an unbreakable wall of force surrounding the entire stalagmite and extending under the cavern floor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="15.">OUTER DOOR AND FOYER</head><p>The tower entrance is on the eastern side of the stalagmite and offers the only access to Ezzat's lair.</p></div>

The outward-facing side of the door bears a bas-relief sculpture of a humanoid skull with a black sapphire embedded in each eye socket. Words of Unwelcome. Carved into the frame above the door are the words "GO AWAY!" written in Common. Alarm. An alarm spell silently warns Ezzat if any other creature opens the door. Treasure. The black sapphires (500 gp each) can be pried out of the door with a dagger or similar tool.</p></div>

In the middle of the room, a wooden chair faces a small wooden table upon which rests a game board topped with painted figurines. Staff. Floating next to the table is a 5-foot-long staff made of chiseled ice.</p><p>Ezzat animated a staff of frost and imbued it with sentience. Because of the alterations made to it, the staff is a creature and no longer usable as a magic item.</p><p>The animated staff is a Medium construct with AC 17, 40 hit points, resistance to cold damage, immunity to poison damage, a flying speed of 30 feet, and the ability to hover. It has blindsight out to a range of 60 feet and is blind beyond this radius. The staff's alignment is neutral evil. It can speak and understand Common. It has the following ability scores: Strength 12, Dexterity 12, Constitution 10, Intelligence 18, Wisdom 14, Charisma 10. Reducing the staff to 0 hit points destroys it.</p><p>The staff is friendly toward Ezzat and Ipses (the lich's pseudodragon), and hostile toward all other creatures. It has no concern for its own well-being and fights without mercy. Ezzat calls off the staff if its destruction seems likely, or if he has cause to parley with intruders.</p><p>The staff can use its action to make a melee weapon attack against a creature within 5 feet of it: +5 to hit; 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage plus 1 cold damage on a hit.</p><p>The staff has 10 charges. As an action, it can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 12): cone of cold (5 charges), fog cloud (1 charge), ice storm ( 4 charges), or wall of ice ( 4 charges). It regains ld6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If the staff expends its last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns to water and is destroyed. A creature can grab the staff out of the air with a successful grapple check against the staff, and grappling the staff does not reduce the creature's speed. Any creature that successfully grapples the staff must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by the staff until the staff is no longer in its grasp. While the creature is charmed, the staff can issue commands to it, which the creature does its best to obey. The creature can repeat the saving throw each time it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that successfully resists the staff's control can't be charmed by it for 24 hours.</p><p>A creature holding the staff that isn't charmed by it can use an action to attempt to break the staff over a knee or against a solid surface, doing so with a successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check. Breaking the staff in this manner destroys it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TREASURE</head><p>The game on the table is called Coroniir, more commonly known as crowns. A game of strategy like chess, it enables two players to reenact a battle of the Crown Wars between two elven coronals. The set features a varnished oak game board and painted wooden figurines, weighs 5 pounds, and is worth 250 gp intact. The game board doubles as a carrying case for the figurines.</p><p>The position of the figurines on the board suggests that a game is in progress. The staff is waiting for Ezzat to return so that they can finish their game, which the lich is presently four moves away from winning. The staff moves its own pieces.</p></div>

Dozens of wax candles light the room, perched atop candle holders or affixed to skulls, petrified rats, and other miscellaneous objects. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BOOKS</head><p>Ezzat has amassed a large collection of books written by self-proclaimed experts on Undermountain. Most of the tomes are filled with information of questionable worth and accuracy. The lich has spent years separating truth from fiction, trying to learn how Halaster's command of the dungeon has gone unchallenged and how Undermountain changes to serve its master's whims.</p><p>Ezzat's]ournal.</p><p>A book lies open on the desk, next to a quill and a jar of ink. This is Ezzat' s journal, a distillation of the lore found in his other books. Any character who reads the journal learns Undermountain's history (see "Dungeon History," page 6) as well as the ways in which the dungeon affects magic (see "Alterations to Magic," page 10). Ezzat's advanced understanding of this lore is what enabled him to create such potent magical defenses around his tower.</p><p>In later entries, Ezzat postulates thatjhesiyra Kestellharp, one of Halaster's original seven apprentices, is the key to seizing control of Undermountain (see ''.Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The lich describes how jhesiyra was imprisoned by her master, only to escape during the Spellplague. She then used a wish spell to imbue herself into the stones of Undermountain and hide from Halaster.</p><p>Ezzat believes thatjhesiyra can affect Undermountain in ways that even Halaster cannot, and the lich longs to find some means to contact her. In the journal's final entry, he writes of wanting to use wish-a spell he does not yet know-to forge an alliance withjhesiyra, defeat Halaster, and end the Mad Mage's reign in Undermountain forever. (The lich doesn't realize thatjhesiyra is beyond the reach of any mortal magic.) </p></div>

Carved into the top of the frame is a human-sized eyeball.</p><p>Ezzat uses the mirror as a focus for his scrying spell. Whenever this mirror is used to scry Halaster, the spell appears to succeed automatically but shows a fa lse image of Ha laster sweeping a dungeon floor with a broom. The image pauses every few minutes to wave at the viewer, do a little dance, or strum the broom as if it were a guitar. Ezzat understands that this scene is one of Halaster's magical tricks, and he does not bother trying to scry the Mad Mage from here. <ref type="table" target="#tab_75">Table.</ref> A stone table cluttered with decrepit alchemical apparatus and dirty bottles of reagents stands at the center of the room. Among the clutter on the table is a small clay bowl containing crystal pebbles (see "Runestone Fragments"). Cabinet. A narrow cabinet with glass doors stands in the northwest corner. Stairs.

Hundreds of pebble-sized crystals (fragments of the Runestone) line the walls, flickering like tiny stars as they catch the light. Ezzat's phylactery is a box 6 inches long, 3 inches wide, and 4 inches tall that weighs 2 pounds. It is made of adamantine with gold trim, and its interior is inscribed with tiny silver runes. A detect magic spell reveals a powerful aura of necromancy magic around it. Any character who examines the box and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes it as a lich's phylactery. (For more information on lich phylacteries, see the "Lich" entry in the Monster Manual.)</p><p>Destroying Ezzat's phylactery requires that it be struck by eight disintegrate spells at the same time. A legend lore spell cast on the box provides the following insight: "Seek out eight magi who possess the power of disintegration and bring them to common purpose. Their combined force can destroy the phylactery." Other reliable divination spells provide similar advice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AFT E RMA TH</head><p>If the characters destroy Ezzat and give his phylactery to one of the genies on level 19 (or remove it from the dungeon themselves), the lich is effectively kicked out of Undermountain. This outcome pleases Halaster, who allows a promising apprentice to take over the stalagmite tower. Drivvin Freth, the drow archmage encountered on level 12, is a good choice. IfDrivvin is unavailable, Halaster invites some other evil archmage to take up residence in the tower.</p><p>Halaster uses a magic scrying sensor (see "Halaster's Lair," page 311) to check on Haungharassk, his prized giant snail, once a day. If he discovers that the snail has been killed or stolen, the Mad Mage uses the Runestone to scream epithets that echo throughout the caverns.</p><p>If the characters destroy the Runestone, Halaster sets out to destroy all the gargoyles and Stonecloaks on this level for failing him. He then begins luring and binding demons to the Runestone Caverns-nalfeshnees, glabrezus, hezrous, and vrocks, for a start. Eventually, he might get around to trapping a demon lord here as well.</p></div>

The gray dwarves have long controlled the mines, first depleting them of mithral, then excavating the iron to supply their forges. Now, Halaster's whims and depraved planar influences have supplanted the duergar as the most dangerous inhabitants of the level.</p><p>The Terminus Level is designed for four 16th-level characters. Those who overcome this level's challenges should gain enough XP to reach 17th level.</p><p>Because duergar feature prominently on this level, consider familiarizing yourself with their entry in the Monster Manual.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WHAT DWELLS HERE?</head><p>The Terminus Level is where Halaster dumps his failed monster experiments. Some time ago, a planetar named Fazrian slew most of these blasphemous horrors, but s uccumbed to its own blood lust. The fallen angel has since claimed the level as its own and judges all intruders who enter its domain. Those found guilty are slain and fed to a trio of otyughs-denizens of the Terminus Level that the planetar deigned to spare.</p><p>The planetar's "court" is full of evil sycophants, including yugoloths that were sent by Halaster to advise Fazrian and duergar under the command of a conniving despot named Valtagar Steelshadow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FAZRIAN THE PLANETAR</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>~~~~~~~~~</head><p>Fazrian is a planetar formerly in the service of Torm, god of courage and self-sacrifice. The planetar was summoned to Undermountain months ago by an adventuring cleric. Sickened by the foulness it beheld, Fazrian sought to cleanse the Terminus Level of corruption, but the magic suffusing Halaster's abominations corrupted the planetar's divine zeal. The more horrors it destroyed, the more joy Fazrian took in their slaughter. Fazrian's fall from grace was swift, culminating in the murder of the cleric and her companions. The planetar now passes judgment on all who s tand before it. Those who lack the willingness to sacrifice themselves for a greater end (such as greedy treasure-seekers drawn to Undermountain for no other reason) are found guilty and executed.</p><p>A mote of goodness still burns within the planetar. If the characters can make Fazrian realize that it has become what it sought to destroy, the planetar will end itself and, with its self-sacrifice, earn Torm's forgiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REGIONAL EFFECTS</head><p>The Terminus Level has been warped by Fazrian's presence, which creates the following magical effects that end when the planetar dies:</p><p>• A faint breeze bears the scent of roses mixed with sulfur.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>YuG O LOTH S</head><p>Ha laster recently sent Fazrian a host of yugoloths to command. They include a pair of arcanaloths named Aximus and Exekarus; the nycaloth, Raxxus; and the ultroloth, Xindulus. Why Fazrian spared these yugoloths and destroyed the others is uncertain, but one could speculate that the planetar didn't want to seem entirely ungrateful. The survivors wormed their way into Fazrian's evil graces, coming to believe that the fallen angel is destined for glory. In Fazrian they see the potential for great rewards-or, at least, compensation beyond the modest sum the Mad Mage promised them. The yugoloths place their own welfare above all others. If more profitable prospects come along, they don't hesitate to abandon Fazrian in favor of whatever lucrative offer catches their attention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DUERGAR C ALASSABRAK</head><p>A duergar prince named Valtagar Steelshadow traveled to Undermountain to plunder its mines and use the wealth to buy his way back into the court of his older brother, King Horgar Steelshadow V, the Deepking of Gracklstugh (see the adventure Out of the Abyss for more information on this subterranean duergar city). Valtagar's problems began years earlier, when he led a hunting expedition into a region of the Underdark patrolled by the drow houses of Menzoberranzan. Valtagar was captured by drow scouts, and Horgar was forced to pay a king's ransom in coin and slaves to free him. Hungry for vengeance, Valtagar and his followers began attacking drow outposts, hoping to foment war between Gracklstugh and Menzoberranzan. When drow ambassadors confronted Horgar with proof of Valtagar's plot, Horgar banished Valtagar and his co-conspirators, who would henceforth be known as calassabrak-outcasts no longer welcome in Gracklstugh.</p><p>After long holding the Deep Mines, Valtagar and his duergar followers were forced back into the Underdark by the planetar's sudden arrival and subsequent bloody crusade. Weeks after retreating, they returned to discover that the mines were much changed and even deadlier than before. The planetar slaughtered a number of Valtagar's followers until the prince stood before the planetar alone, empty-handed and daring the fallen angel to kill him. Valtagar's gesture of self-sacrifice moved Fazrian, who judged him worthy of remaining alive. Valtagar now holds a tenuous position as Lord of the Mines, one of the fallen angel's advisors. Despite now being "vassals" of Fazrian, all the duergar on this level remain loyal to their prince and follow Valtagar's orders without question.</p><p>Valtagar intends to overthrow Fazrian, buy off the yugoloths, and seize control of the Terminus Level. Toward that end, he is quick to forge alliances with adventurers who are also interested in bringing about the planetar's downfall. </p></div>

The guards in area lOb notice any light or noise here and quickly investigate. The room has the following features: Malgorn is one card away from owning a complete deck of Three-Dragon Ante cards made of thin-pressed gold. He has begun obsessing over the missing card (';The Thief") and complains about it incessantly. He has found the other cards scattered throughout the Terminus Level and is storing them in a pouch tied to his belt. He's not optimistic about finding the last card, though. Sick of hearing about the situation, Zelk adds to Malgorn's misery by repeatedly asking him if he has searched in places he knows Malgorn has already thoroughly checked.</p><p>Treasure. Each of the sixty-nine gold cards in Malgorn's incomplete deck is worth 10 gp, but the set is worth 2,500 gp once the deck contains all seventy cards. The characters can find the missing card in area 23c. The cook, Lorga, prepares bland mushroom stew. Despite his blinding cataracts, he knows his way around the kitchen and the adjoining pantry. If he hears one or more characters enter, he shouts in Dwarvish, "The stew will be ready when it's ready! Get out, lest ye taste none of it!" If they don't leave at once, he says, "My eyes are clouded, but my ears and nose work fine. Test not my resolve!" A lesser restoration spell or similar magic restores Lorga's sight. He offers no thanks to whoever rids him of the disability. As dour and pessimistic as any other duergar, he quickly finds something else to complain about.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.">KITC H EN AND PANTRY</head><p>Lorga poses no threat (0 XP). He merely wishes to die serving Valtagar, whom he has known since the prince was a child. Lorga isn't holding out hope that he'll ever hear the belching forges of Gracklstugh again, but it infuriates him that Valtagar-a duergar prince-must kowtow to the "mad giant" Fazrian. Lorga suggests that the characters locate Valtagar and forge an alliance with him before they all fall to the giant's sword.</p><p>Once the hot coals are doused or swept from the fireplace, the chimney can be climbed easily. After 90 feet, it breaks into a damp, soot-stained natural cave roughly 50 feet square.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="12.">MINERS' POTTY</head><p>Thin, crumbling brick walls divide the northern half of this 10-foot-high room into three s talls, each one tucked behind a rusty chain-link curtain that hangs limply from the ceiling. Cut into the floor of each stall is a circular hole that leads to a cesspit. The giant horn weighs 2 tons. It dangles 20 feet above the floor on three thick, 5-foot-long iron chains. The Melairkyn dwarves forged the horn and placed it here to guard the treasure in this hall (see "Treasure" below). A detect magic spell or similar magic reveals an aura of conjuration magic around the horn. A character who understands Dwarvish can translate the horn's runes not all of which are visible from the floor. The runes ' visible from the floor read, "If you blind us." A character must fly up to the horn or climb above it to read the message in its entirety, which is "If you blind us, shall we not revenge?"</p><p>Removing one or more gemstones from the pillars causes the horn to magically emit a somber tone. As the horn sounds, the spirits of thirteen dwarf warriors appear in unoccupied spaces throughout the hall and attack all other creatures in the area. These unaligned spirits use the champion statistics (see appendix A), except that they wield greataxes instead of greatswords. They understand Dwarvish but can't speak, and they can't leave the hall. They disappear after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once the horn has sounded, it can't sound again until 7 days have passed. If no gemstones remain in the pillars when this time elapses, the horn becomes nonmagical and can no longer summon dwarven spirits. Removing the instrument from the hall also renders it nonmagical. TREASURE Eight blue star sapphires (1,000 gp each) are embedded in the eyes of the dwarf carvings-two gemstones per pillar. Each gem is set 18 feet above the floor and can be pried out with a dagger or similar tool.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14.">SHRINE OF LADUGUER</head><p>As a gesture of goodwill toward its new duergar allies, Fazrian had this waiting chamber converted into a shrine of Laduguer, the duergar god of labor and slavery. Presiding over the shrine are two arcanaloths named Aximus and Exekarus. These fiends use alter self spells to appear as duergar priests. Valtagar and the duergar Haze. A thin, smoky haze fills the room. (The haze doesn't obscure the room's other features.) Braziers. Alcoves in the north wall contain two braziers fashioned from melted-down iron armor and weapons. Each is alight with burning coals that shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Altar a nd Shield. Between the alcoves, an iron altar traced with s ilver and shaped like a giant anvil rests beneath a round, 10-foot-diameter iron shield mounted on the north wall. The shield bears the symbol of a broken arrow with a jagged arrowhead. Standing before the a ltar are a pair of duergar (Aximus and Exekarus) in drab robes.</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">LEVEL 21 I TERMINUS Ll!VEl.</formula><p>To prepare for their roles, the arcanaloths learned everything they could about Laduguer's principles of conduct. To their surprise, Aximus and Exekarus found these principles compelling. Some of the arcanaloths' favorite maxims include:</p><p>• "No matter how much wealth and power you have, it's never enough." • "The fight never ends. Take what you deserve and destroy all who stand in your way." • "Let no emotion rule you. Abandon joy, love, pride, anger, and ambition, for they are signs of weakness. Know your role and perform it to the best of your ability."</p><p>Laduguer's dogma guides Aximus and Exekarus as much as it does any duergar, and the yugoloths try to impose these principles on all who claim to serve Fazrian. If the characters haven't encountered Fazrian, Aximus and Exekarus insist on taking them to meet the planetar, whom they admire. Those who refuse to accompany the arcanaloths are left behind as Aximus and Exekarus proceed to area 23b to inform Fazrian that visitors have arrived. Obedience to Fazrian is all that matters to Aximus and Exekarus-at least until someone convinces the arcanaloths to switch allegiances.</p><p>The arcanaloths' attitude toward the characters is indifferent at the start, though the fiends quickly turn hostile if attacked. The arcanaloths' attitude changes to friendly if the characters appeal to their love of magic by giving them a single very rare magic item, multiple rare magic items, or a spellbook containing at least one spell of 6th level or higher. Aximus and Exekarus make their love of all things magical known to anyone that seeks their assistance. If their attitude toward the characters is changed in this way, the arcanaloths repay the party's kindness any way they can-short of placing themselves in harm's way. Their helpfulness doesn't last long, however. After 24 hours, the arcanaloths' attitude toward the party becomes indifferent once more, and further bribes are needed to regain their assistance. </p></div>

The duergar are a male named Brok and a female named Fumira. Brok uses long-handled iron tongs to place chunks of iron ore in the forge. Once the iron melts, Fumira scoops out the molten iron with a long-handled ladle and pours it into two iron molds, which Brok clamps shut. They then take the clamped molds to area 16c to cool.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>23A. GRAND FOYER</head><p>The 18-foot-high double doors to the west swing inward, revealing a stone-tiled foyer with a 40-foot-high ceiling.</p><p>The area contains the following features:</p><p>Braziers. The foyer is heated and dimly lit by two 6-foottall, 6-foot-wide s tone braziers filled with burning coals. Smoke and embers rise from each. Statues. Extending eastward from the foyer is a 20-footwide, 30-foot-high arched hall lined with 15-foot-tall iron statues of armored dwarves draped in cobwebs.</p><p>Continual flame spells flicker behind the eye holes of their helms, and their iron greataxes are raised high.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>23B . HALL OF FINALjUDGMENT</head><p>The floor of this 40-foot-high chamber is shaped like the head of a double-bladed axe. The room, which smells of roses and sulfur, contains the following:</p><p>Fazrian and Fiend. A hairless, green-skinned planetar with white-feathered wings and eyes of molten silver sits on a bone throne in a raised alcove. Lurking in the shadows behind the throne is Raxxus, a nycaloth. (The yugoloth passively guards the wall behind it, which contains a secret door to area 24.) Braziers. The chamber is dimly lit by four 6-foot-tall, 6-foot-wide stone braziers filled with burning coals that produce smoke and embers. S tanding Gate. To the north stands a pair of crystal menhirs, each imprisoning a marilith. Open Pit. A gaping pit lies to the south, its rectangular mouth measuring 10 feet wide by 20 feet long by 30 feet deep, with a 20-foot-high, 20-foot-wide passage at the bottom leading south. Characters near the lip of the pit can hear large creatures (the otyughs in area 23c) shuffling in the darkness below.</p><p>Fazrian is a lawful evil planetar that lacks the Healing Touch action option. Unless he is incapacitated, Fazrian can take one of the following lair actions on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties) while on the Terminus Level: Once an exemplar of courage and good judgment, Fazrian now seeks to destroy any creature it believes is undeserving of continued existence. Fazrian's views are a mockery of what they once were. Every creature is guilty of "deformity" in the planetar's eyes. Unless someone can swiftly prove their innocence, Fazrian sentences that individual to an immediate death.</p><p>Persuading the planetar to render a verdict of not guilty requires at least one party member to submit to Fazrian's judgment. That character must then offer to surrender their own life to spare the lives of the others. Any character who stands before Fazrian and shows both courage and self-sacrifice is found innocent of the crime of deformity. Denials, protests, and challenges to Fazrian's authority are met with stern pronouncements of guilt. The planetar can tell when it is being lied to (thanks to its Divine Awareness trait), and characters who lie to Fazrian are immediately judged guilty.</p><p>The planetar has delusions of raising an army to sweep through Undermountain and purge it of those it deems abhorrent. Before letting innocents off the hook, Fazrian demands that they each swear an oath to serve it henceforth. Those who refuse to take the oath are found guilty of the crime of cowardice and sentenced to death.</p><p>Once judgment is rendered, Fazrian orders Raxxus to step forth, slay the guilty party or parties, and cast their bodies into the pit (see area 23c). After the guilty have been punished, those found innocent are escorted by Raxxus to the arcanaloths in area 14 for indoctrination. If the nycaloth is killed, the planetar takes up its sword and attacks the guilty.</p><p>Only a character judged innocent by Fazrian can alter the planetar's disposition enough to make it realize how corrupt it has become. Such a character can use an action to call on the planetar to look inward and judge itself, making a DC 26 Charisma (Persuasion) check as part of that action. If the player roleplays well, grant the character advantage on the check. A character who gets a failure on the check can't try again, but they can still help another character who then tries to convince the planetar of its own guilt. On a successful check of this sort, a lingering shred of goodness in Fazrian is awakened. The planetar weeps as it begs Torm for forgiveness. Then, in a final act of atonement and self-sacrifice, it impales itself on its sword and dies .</p><p>If the planetar dies by its own hand or at the hands of the characters, Torm bestows on each character a blessing of protection (see "Supernatural Gifts" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). This blessing is permanent if its receiver is a worshiper of Torm; otherwise, the blessing lasts for 10 days. Torm's blessing is • The gate opens for 1 minute if a creature speaks the proper command word within 10 feet of it. • Characters must be 15th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes," page 12). • A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 7 on level 19, in the closest unoccupied space next to the similar gate located there.</p></div>

The floor of the tunnel is covered with bones, bits of adventuring gear, and other debris. At the end of the tunnel lurk three hungry otyughs. When they detect other creatures in the pit, they rush forth and attack while using their Limited Telepathy to taunt prey.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="24.">SE CR ET VAULT</head><p>This oval chamber has a domed ceiling 20 feet high, as well as the following features: Bloody Hand. Dry blood stains every surface except for a patch in the shape of a giant hand on the back wall. Head and Mace. Piled in the middle of the room are ten shattered stone chests. A mace and a headless human corpse lie on the floor next to this rubble. The corpse's severed head lies a few feet away. Maggots feast on the rotting remains.</p><p>Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check realizes that the hand shape on the back wall resembles the symbol of Torm.</p><p>Characters who witnessed the ghostly scene in area 7 recognize the corpse as that of the cleric in the vision. Brythia Mulspeer and her adventuring companions were exploring Undermountain when the perils became too much for them. Brythia petitioned Torm for aid, and Fazrian answered the summons. The planetar provided much-needed assistance and healing, then chose to remain by Brythia's side as the adventurers descended deeper into Undermountain. When blood lust finally took hold of the planetar, it turned on the adventurers and decapitated Brythia with its greatsword. This former cleric of Torm can be questioned using speak with dead. Having succumbed to Fazrian's blood lust, Brythia wishes only to see the planetar redeemed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TREASURE</head><p>The mace is a mace of smiting that belonged to Brythia. Characters who witnessed the ghostly scene in area 7 recognize the mace as the weapon used by the cleric in that vision.</p><p>The stone chests once contained coins hidden here by Melairkyn dwarves. The duergar broke open the chests and dumped the coins in a mining cart in area 18d.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AFTERMATH</head><p>Fazrian's death enables the duergar to regain control of the Terminus Level. Valtagar has no immediate plans other than to fortify the level and prepare for his eventual return to Gracklstugh.</p><p>Any yugoloths that remain make the best of a bad situation. Aximus and Exekarus are more likely to aJly with the duergar than with a band of adventurers, while Raxxus prefers to accompany the adventurers rather than stay with the duergar. If Xindulus is alive, the ultroloth takes its chances in Shadowdusk Hold (level 22), trying to forge an alliance with the death knights there.</p><p>Regardless of what happens, the Mad Mage continues to use the Terminus Level as a dumping ground for failed monster experiments. Characters who leave the level and later return might encounter one or more of these horrors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WHAT DWELLS HERE?</head><p>A Waterdavian noble family driven into exile long ago has carved out a home for itself on this level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T HE SH A DOWDUSKS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>~~~~~~~~~</head><p>The Shadowdusk family, like many other Waterdavian noble lineages, made its fortune in trading. Three sisters named Arandraya, Maelweene, and Yarlithra Shadowdusk became famous for sponsoring and then leading adventuring expeditions into Undermountain. One of the items they recovered from the dungeon was a tablet of black crystal that allowed contact with entities of the Far Realm. Their brother, Xerrion, came to possess the tablet and used it to contact otherworldly beings in an attempt to destroy his family's business rivals and political enemies. This contact drove Xerrion mad, and it didn't take long for the madness to spread to other members of the S hadowdusk family and come into public view. As the family's behavior grew more bizarre, local broadsheets circulated rumors that the Shadowdusks had been replaced by aberrant horrors in human guise. Their ancestra l villa, S hadowdusk Hold, was burned to the ground in the Year of the Harp (1355 DR). The Waterdavian authorities who investigated the blaze never made their findings public, but the commonly held belief is that the city's Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors was responsible.</p><p>All three of Xerrion's sisters were killed in the fire that consumed Shadowdusk Hold. Xerrion escaped and fled to his sisters' redoubt in the depths of Undermountain. From there, he used sending spells to contact Shadowdusk family members living abroad and brought them to live with him in a twisted, underground version of Shadowdusk Hold. Among those who answered the call was Margaras te Shadowdusk, a distant cousin whom Xerrion would later marry.</p><p>Level 22 of Undermountain became a safe haven where the S hadowdusks could treat with Far Realm horrors away from the prying eyes of their fellow Waterdavians. In the end, Xerrion and Margaraste stepped through a gateway into the Far Realm and were never seen again. In their absence, the torch of leadership passed to Xerrion's niece and nephew, Dezmyr and Zaltharthe twin children of his late sister Yarlithra. These former paladins of Torm abandoned their faith long ago, becoming death knights.</p><p>Over the years, Ha laster Blackcloak has kept his eye on the S hadowdusks and their plots, even as he allows the family free rein in their corner of his domain. The Mad Mage has decided that these are the kinds of nobles that need to be making decisions and wielding power in Waterdeepso that he can secretly rule the city using them as puppets. As such, he encourages the S hadowdus ks to consolidate power in preparation for a triumphant and bloody return to Waterdeep, after which Halaster will seize power as the city's Shadow Lord. The Shadowdusk family motto used to be "No secrets without truth." After the family's fall, its motto changed to "We do not fear the darkness." The family' s crest is a lit torch with three embers rising from the flame, set against a purple background. In the wake of the family's descent into Undermountain and madness, this crest has been literally turned upside down, so that the torch flame points downward.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DEZMYR AND ZALTHAR</head><p>The current leaders of Shadowdusk Hold are the twins Dezmyr and Zalthar Shadowdusk. They have remained close throughout life and undeath, and might have led their mortal family skillfully if circumstances had played out differently.</p><p>The twins are devoted to each other and are obsessed with returning their family to prominence and ultimately seizing control of Waterdeep.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPLORING THIS LEVEL</head><p>All location descriptions for this level are keyed to map 22.</p><p>The following features apply throughout S hadowdusk Hold unless otherwise noted in an area's description: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TIER I</head><p>The uppermost tier of Shadowdusk Hold closely resembles the style and architecture of the family manor in Waterdeep before it was destroyed. This section of the hold resembles a mausoleum. The Far Realm's influence on this tier is faint. Two members of the Shadowdusk family reside here: a wizard named Melissara Shadowdusk and her mad husband, Derrion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">GRA ND FOYER</head><p>The stairs from level 21 descend to a grand entry chamber that contains the following features: The statues show the Shadowdusk twins, Zalthar and Dezmyr, as they appeared in life. Zalthar's statue is in the west alcove and stands 6 feet 11 inches tall. Dezmyr's statue to the east stands 6 feet 3 inches tall. An inscription on the bottom of each statue identifies its subject.</p><formula xml:id="formula_34">LEVEL 22 I SHADOWDUSK HOLD</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">TWISTED GALLERY</head><p>Bas-Reliefs. The curved walls are lined with bas-relief carvings, and plaques mounted beneath them tell the story of a forgotten Waterdavian family. Statues. Two 9-foot-tall statues stand on raised platforms in alcoves to the north and south.</p><p>The bas-reliefs carvings depict Arandraya, Maelweene, and Yarlithra Shadowdusk negotiating trade deals in Waterdeep, exploring Undermountain in their free time, pouring treasure into family coffers, and giving a black tablet to their brother, Xerrion. The carvings go on to show the original Shadowdusk Hold (in Waterdeep) on fire, Xerrion Shadowdusk escaping into Undermountain with the black tablet, the creation of a new Shadowdusk Hold in the dungeon's depths, Xerrion's marriage to Lady Margaraste, and the married couple stepping through a gate of tentacles into the Far Realm.</p><p>A successful DC 15 Intelligence (History) check identifies the family crest in the reliefs-a lit torch with an orange flame and three embers trailing off it-and the two mottoes of House Shadowdusk: "No secrets without truth" and "We do not fear the darkness." The crest appears upright in earlier scenes and inverted in later scenes. A character who recognizes the crest and the family mottoes also knows that the Shadowdusks were presumed destroyed.</p><p>The statue to the north depicts Lord Xerrion Shadowdusk, a male human of middle age with regal bearing and sharp features. The south statue depicts Lady Margaraste Shadowdusk, a middle-aged fema le human with long, curly hair and a kind smile. An inscription on the bottom of each statue identifies its subject.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">WESTWI NG</head><p>Four nothics lurk in the northern arm of this L-shaped gallery, poring over wall carvings and chattering to themselves.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4B . MAD CREATURE</head><p>Nothic. A nothic squats near the east wall, frantically scratching at the stone. Scrawls. Scrawled exhortations in Deep Speech and Undercommon cover the walls, floor, and ceiling.</p><p>The nothic used to be an apprentice mage named Rhamagant, who served as Vertrand Shadowdusk's assistant (see area 17 for more information about Vertrand). The nothic remembers nothing of its previous life and fights only in self-defense. A character who questions the nothic in a language it understands can glean the following useful information amid its mad ravings:</p><p>• This level of Undermountain is called Shadowdusk Hold, and it has three tiers. • The deeper into Shadowdusk Hold one goes, the closer one gets to the Far Realm. • There's a secret room on each tier.</p><p>The nothic knows the locations of all the secret doors leading to the secret rooms in Shadowdusk Hold <ref type="bibr">(areas 11, 23b, and 37)</ref>. Any character who can communicate with the nothic can, with a successful DC 20 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check, convince it to accompany the party and point out secret doors. When it comes within 10 feet of a secret door in Shadowdusk Hold, the nothic begins scratching at it while muttering the words "secret door" in Undercommon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">S TOREROOM</head><p>Cold. This chamber is kept magically cold. Shelves. Shelves line every wall, a ll of them stacked with wine, a le, and perishable food. Casks. Several wooden casks of drinkable water stand along one wall.</p></div>

MELISSARA'S CHAMBER Melissara. A middle-aged woman (Melissara Shadowdusk) sits in an easy chair in the northeast corner, reading and muttering to herself. Other Furnishings. A canopied bed and an armoire stand against the south wall, and a silk curtain obscures a corridor to the north. Secret Door. A secret door in the east wall opens into Melissara's study (area 11).</p><p>Melissara has so far managed to escape the horrible insanity that besets the rest of her fam ily, but she can sense that her mind is slowly being eroded by contact with the Far Realm. Fearing that her descent into madness is inevitable, she lives in a state of self-imposed exile and chooses to remain in Shadowdusk Hold despite every instinct telling her to flee. If the characters address her in a civilized manner, Melissara listens to what they have to say. She then implores them to destroy Dezmyr and Zalthar before they can enact their plan to conquer Waterdeep, not realizing that death knights are not so easily vanquished. Melissara asks that she and Derrion be left out of the ensuing conflict and provides the following information to the characters in good faith:</p><p>All members of the Shadowdusk family have, to some extent, been corrupted by the Far Realm. To the best of Melissara's knowledge, the damage is irreparable. Other family members living in Shadowdusk Hold include Melissara's three cousins: the wizards Berlain, Cassiok, and Vertrand. Dezmyr and Zalthar are death knights that dwell on the lower tiers of Shadowdusk Hold. Contact with the Far Realm has given Dezmyr the ability to warp reality to a limited extent. Zalthar has no such ability but wields a sword that drains souls. • The lowest tier of Shadowdusk Hold is home to a blue dracolich in league with the death knights. (Melissara knows the dracolich's phylactery is hidden somewhere in Shadowdusk Hold, but doesn't know where.)</p><p>If the characters have no interest in conversing with Melissara, she uses dimension door to get to area 11 and sends her lunatic husband to eliminate them.</p><p>Treasure. The armoire holds fine clothing and a wooden jewelry box containing a pair of matching gold bracelets (250 gp each), a gold-and-pearl necklace (1,250 gp), and the key to the strongbox in area lOb.</p></div>

These include a simple bed to the west, a dresser filled with clothes to the east, and a weapon and armor rack.</p><p>Derrion enjoys killing unwelcome visitors. He is a human champion (see appendix A), with these changes:</p><p>• Derrion is chaotic evil.</p><p>• He speaks Common and Deep Speech.</p><p>• Derrion stores his weapons and plate armor on the equipment racks. If he doesn't have time to don his plate armor, he makes do with a chain shirt (AC 15).</p><p>Derrion accompanies Melissara whenever she leaves their suite, fearing that she will come to harm without his protection. He lives in constant fear that adventurers might invade Shadowdusk Hold and lay waste to it. Prolonged exposure to the Far Realm has made him sleep-deprived and irritable. His eyes are bloodshot, and he hears whispers of things that aren't real. Only Melissara can control his inexplicable rage toward visitors. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BOOKCASE</head><p>The bookcase's glass doors aren't locked.</p><p>Treasure. The bottom drawer is sealed with an arcane lock spell cast by Melissara. Inside is a small black journal. The first page of the book is trapped with a glyph of warding spell, whose explosive runes deal fire damage (save DC 15). The glyph is keyed to go off if anyone but Melissara opens the journal (a precaution to prevent her cousins from reading it and discovering her secrets).</p><p>The journal details Melissara's unease with her family, as well as her growing fear of losing her mind and soul to the Far Realm. She seems desperate to use her writings in the journal as a touchstone to her own mind.</p></div>

Berlain's spellbook rests atop the lectern.</p><p>It contains all the spells she has prepared, plus fireball and modify memory.</p><p>The tapestry weighs 40 pounds and is worth 250 gp (assuming the characters can find a buyer who appreciates its disturbing imagery).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>18B. BEDCHAMBER</head><p>Furnishings. A chest of drawers and a bed heaped with pillows stand along the west wall. A sitting area with comfortable chairs is set up against the east wall. Monsters. A mutated humanoid (Berlain Shadowdusk) sits on the edge of the bed, patching gashes in her robe. Floating nearby are two grells.</p><p>A little over a year ago, Berlain and her brother Korva briefly entered the Far Realm, whereupon they became fused into a single physical form. This merging obliterated most of Korva's body and personality, leaving Berlain with an extra mouth and an extra set of arms that once belonged to her brother. She also inherited a few of his internal organs and personality traits. She can speak using one or both of her mouths.</p><p>Berlain has dirty blonde hair, piercing dark eyes, and two mouths where one would normally be-one below the other, canted at an angle. Sprouting from her misshapen shoulders are two pairs of arms-her original limbs above those of her brother. She wears a poorly stitched robe made from other garments and designed to fit her mutated form.</p><p>Berlain has a close kinship with Vertrand, and the two wizards work well together. Berlain has no interest in forging alliances with visitors and tries to capture intruders for use as experimental subjects.</p><p>Berlain is an archmage, with these changes: The grells serve as Berlain's valets, and she communicates with them in their own language. The grells try to grapple and subdue intruders on sight.</p><p>Treasure. The chest of drawers contains torn-up scraps of clothing. In the bottom drawer is an unlocked coffer containing 300 gp, a polished crystal orb carved to look like a glistening doppelganger eyeball (usable as an arcane focus), and a spell scroll of flesh to stone.</p></div>

Measuring 30 feet long by 15 feet tall, it depicts a stately, ivy-covered mansion and estate that once stood in Waterdeep-the original Shadowdusk Hold. Situated in small niches that form the mansion's windows are tiny, 3-inch-tall painted wooden busts representing members of the Shadowdusk household circa 1355 DR. Characters who have seen other depictions of Arandraya, Maelweene, Yarlithra, and Xerrion Shadowdusk recognize their tiny likenesses alongside the busts of other family members and servants. Two window niches are noticeably empty, because Zalthar has removed the busts within (see area 34a).</p></div>

Five steps lead to the top of a stone dais, at the back of which is a set of gold-plated double doors that open into area 22.</p><p>If visitors arrive unannounced, the will-o'-wisps become visible and impatiently question the new arrivals. Characters must present a plausible reason for their presence and succeed on a DC 20 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check to convince the will-o'-wisps not to attack them. If they don't like what they hear, three of the wisps attack. The other two break away to warn Vertrand (area 17) and Berlain (area 18b), who, along with Berlain's grell valets, converge on this area. If a battle erupts here, the nothics in area 20b join the fray.</p></div>

The wall behind the altar bears a fresco of a large white gauntlet (the symbol of Torm). Statues. Standing in the "tips" of the crescent-shaped room, flanking the altar, are a pair of life-size stone statues that depict human paladins clad in plate armor.

Any bright light that shines into this room or inside it is reduced to dim light, and dim light is reduced to darkness. Darkvision functions normally here. A stone table rests against the waJI opposite the door. A tablet made of black crystal inscribed with strange writing rests on the table. The tablet is cold to the touch, and its writing appears to writhe.</p><p>Treasure. Xerrion Shadowdusk originally used the tablet to contact beings of the Far Realm. Other family members have used it for similar purposes over the years. It weighs 11 pounds and measures 7 inches wide, 13 inches tall, and 2 inches thick.</p><p>The black crystal tablet is a legendary magic item that requires attunement by a creature that has proficiency in the Arcana s kill. Any creature that attunes to the tablet must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw at the end of its next long rest. On a failed save, the creature becomes afflicted with a random form of long-term madness (see "Madness" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).</p><p>As an action, a creature attuned to the black crystal tablet can use it to cast eyebite or gate (the portal created by this spell links to the Far Realm only).

Set into the middle of the floor is a 20-foot-diameter disk of purple stone, inscribed upon which is the Shadowdusk crest: a lit torch with three trailing embers, its orange flame pointed toward the double door to the west. Mosaics. The 40-foot-high, vaulted ceiling bears peeling mosaics of cloudy, dramatically lit skies. Scorch Marks. The walls and pillars have numerous scorch marks. Statues. Four 8-foot-tall statues of human nobles stand in wide alcoves to the north and south.</p><p>A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check can ascertain that the scorch marks on the walls and pillars were made by a blue dragon's breath weapon. Years ago, Halaster lured a dracolich named Lynnorax to Shadowdusk Hold. Dezmyr and Zalthar pressed the dracolich into service. The dracolich waits for intruders in area 40 and guards the death knights' vault (area 41).</p><p>The statues in the northern alcoves depict Arandraya and Maelweene Shadowdusk. The statues to the south depict their brother, Xerrion, and their other sister, Yarlithra. Each statue stands atop a 2-foot-high block of stone that bears an inscription of the noble's name.</p><p>Secret Door. A locked secret door is hidden in the wall next to the statue of Xerrion in the southwest alcove. A character who examines the statue and succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check notices that one of the rings on Xerrion's left hand can be twisted around his finger. Turning the ring unlocks the secret door and causes it to swing open into area 37.</p></div>

The closer a creature comes to the doors, the more uneasy it feels. Slaadi. Four invisible death slaadi stand in front of the double door leading to area 32. The slaadi serve at the pleasure of Dezmyr and Zalthar, and they attack intruders on sight. Tapestry. A tapestry on the east wall depicts a group of humans twisting, warping, and melting into one amorphous, blasphemous entity.</p><p>Treasure. The tapestry weighs 50 pounds and is worth 750 gp to one who appreciates such horrid decor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="32.">FAR AND GONE</head><p>The curving west wall of this room is a seething mass of color and sickly light-a partially breached portal to the Far Realm. Creatures can't physically pass through the portal, but the Far Realm's influence bleeds out into the Material Plane from this place. A character can ascertain the true nature of the portal with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check.</p><p>Any creature that comes into contact with the back wall must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by the wall for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature is stunned and stares at the wall, absorbing the power and madness of the Far Realm. The effect ends if the creature takes damage, or if another creature uses an action to shake or slap it. When the effect ends, the creature that was charmed gains a random form of indefinite madness (see "Madness" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).</p></div>

It radiates a strong aura of abjuration magic under the scrutiny of a detect magic spell or similar magic, and a paladin us ing Divine Sense can detect a celestial presence trapped within it.</p><p>Characters who have a combined Strength of 60 or higher can topple the obelisk, which is a Huge object with AC 17, 90 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Toppling or destroying the obelisk releases a couatl trapped within. The couatl, named Tezca-Zyanya, appears in the form of a Tiny yellow frog. Using its telepathy, the disguised couatl thanks the characters for releasing it. Exposure to the Far Realm has deprived the couatl of its memories, including those that would explain its entrapment and the purpose of the obelisk.</p><p>If the party includes no evil characters, Tezca-Zyanya offers to accompany its rescuers and assist them until its services are no longer required. It continues to pass itself off as a frog until circumstances force it to reveal its true form. Trapped in the obelisk for millennia, it knows nothing about Undermountain or Waterdeep.</p></div>

Dezmyr Shadowdusk (see below) stands in the middle of the room, clad in ancient armor and joined by six wraiths (her counselors). Portra its. Dozens of framed portraits hang from hooks on the south and west walls. (The portraits represent various members of the Shadowdusk family. All the depictions are warped in subtle ways. Some of the family members have starry eyes, while others have melted flesh or tentacles sprouting from their faces.) Fresco. A 10-foot-square, tiled fresco on the middle of the east wall depicts Dezmyr and Zalthar Shadowdusk as heavily armored human paladins of Torm, riding on armored horses and brandishing shields. Zalthar's shield is mostly hidden behind his body and horse, but displayed prominently on Dezmyr's shield is the Shadowdusk family crest (a lit, upright torch with three embers trailing off it, set against a purple disk).</p><p>Dezmyr is so touched by the Far Realm that she speaks in riddles. As soon as one or more characters enter the room, she says, "The stars turn, and a time presents itself." She then draws her sword and attacks, aided by the wraiths. Dezmyr is a death knight, with these changes:</p><p>• As a bonus action on her turn, Dezmyr can warp reality, undoing damage dealt to herself or another creature that she can see within 20 feet of her. The beneficiary of this warped reality instantly regains 10 hit points. • She has the locate creature spell prepared instead of banishment. • She speaks Abyssal, Common, and Deep Speech.</p><p>Secret Door. Set into the east wall, north of the fresco of Dezmyr on horseback, is a locked secret door. Any character who studies the fresco and succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check can tell that the family crest on Dezmyr's shield can be rotated. Turning it so that the torch is upside down instead of upright unlocks the secret door and causes it to swing open into area 37.</p></div>

Their ambition and hatred burn too fiercely for them to be able to give up their dreams of conquest, and they are too corrupted by the Far Realm to be redeemed.</p><p>If they return to find the rest of their family destroyed, the death knights expand their hatred to include the adventurers who dared oppose them. Out of desperation, the twins try to forge alliances with other denizens of Undermountain, such as the drow of House Auvryndar or House Freth, the mind flayers of Seadeeps (level 17), or the cult of Shar in Vanrakdoom (level 18). If no such allies remain, Dezmyr and Zalthar look deep into the Underdark and the Far Realm, drawing forth aberrant horrors by offering them promises of a new life in Undermountain.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_297">An alcove to the south contains a life-size,  painted stone statue ofHalaster perched atop a 4-foottall granite plinth like a vulture, squatting with a rms  outstretched and fingers curled like talons, as</ref>  Targeting an animated fresco with a dispel magic spell has no effect other than to cause Halaster's image to silently mock the spell's caster.

Although detached from their bodies, the heads remain alive and sedate as a result of Halaster's magic. Tapping on a jar is enough to stir a head to consciousness. The heads speak only the languages they knew in life and have no recollection of how they ended up in their disembodied state. A character can prompt a head for information, which it's happy to provide. Each head shares one Undermountain secret determined by drawing a card from the Secrets Deck (see appendix C). A head can also confirm that Halaster spends a lot of time on this level of Undermountain.</p><p>Removing a head from a jar or removing a jar from this room ends the magic that animates the head, which immediately dies.</p></div>

These constructs attack intruders on sight and fly after those who flee. The dotted circle on map 23 marks the edge of the dome, which was created by a wall of force spell made permanent by Halaster. The dome can't be dispelled by dispel magic, but a disintegrate spell destroys it, freeing the invisible stalkers within.</p><p>The invisible stalkers attack any creature other than Halaster that enters the dome using magic (such as a dimension door or misty step spell). They also attack if the dome is destroyed. The stalkers like to gang up on one opponent at a time.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6A. LIGHTNING PILLARS</head><p>This two-chambered hall has a 20-foot-high ceiling supported by ten copper-plated pillars of iron. The pillars generate arcs of magic lightning, as well as bolts that leap from one pillar to another. Creatures standing outside the hall are safe, as are creatures within the 20-foot-square space marked on map 23. A creature that ends its turn in any other space in the hall is struck by lightning from the nearest pillar and must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p>A character who uses an action to study the pillars and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check notices a pattern in the lightning discharges and gains advantage on saving throws made against the pillars. In addition, the character identifies the safe space in the middle of the hall.</p></div>

ANGELIC SHIELD</head><p>Mounted on the door to this chamber is a bronze knocker shaped like Halaster's mad visage, his beard entwined around the knocker's ring-shaped handle. A tiny bronze plaque mounted below the knocker reads in Common, "Knock first before entering."</p><p>Using the knocker triggers a glyph of warding spell cast at 8th level. The glyph creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of magical flame. Each creature in the area must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The tiny glyph can be found on the backside of the knocker's handle with a successful DC 22 Intelligence (Investigation) check. This room contains wooden trestle tables laden with material components for spells, including linen-wrapped slabs of butter, casks of licorice root shavings, bottles of snake tongues, a terrarium filled with glowworms, and wax-sealed jars of rotting eggs.</p></div>

The characters can use divination magic to determine the correct answer if they can't work it out.</p><p>Speaking Melair's name aloud while standing in the room causes the symbols on the pillars to glow bright colors. The symbols continue to glow for 1 minute. During that time, any creature that enters the area inside the pillars or starts its turn there is teleported to a similar location in area 8, along with anything it is wearing or carrying.</p></div>

While trapped in the shield, Aryx can't communicate with anyone. Any ability that detects the presence of celestials, such as a paladin's Divine Sense class feature, reveals the presence of such a creature bound within the shield. If a dispel evil or good spell is cast on the shield, or if the shield comes within 10 feet of a fiend, the deva is released, appearing within 5 feet of the shield or in the nearest unoccupied space. Once freed, the deva uses its detect evil and good spell to determine if there are any evil creatures in its presence. If so, Aryx attacks them, targeting fiends above all others .</p><p>Aryx was sent by Tyr, the god of justice, to talk some sense into Fazrian, the fallen planetar on level 21. Before Aryx could approach Fazrian, however, Halaster trapped the deva in the shield. Aryx must complete its mission before it can return to Tyr's heavenly realm. If the characters claim to have killed Fazrian or helped the planetar achieve atonement, the deva uses a commune spell to verify as much. If the characters speak the truth, Aryx shows its gratitude by granting each party member a blessing of health (see "Supernatural Gifts" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). </p></div>

Creatures that pass through the doorway get no sense that they're leaving Undermountain and entering Halaster's extradimensional tower.</p><p>Whenever a double door in this area is opened-except the one to the south (see above)-the pillar emits colored rays from its myriad notches, duplicating the effect of a prismatic spray spell (save DC 22) that targets all creatures within 60 feet of the pillar. Any creature that would be transported to another plane by this effect instead appears in the arms of the Halaster statue in area 22. Beyond the secret door is a circular room with a 20-foot-high, domed ceiling. It has these features: Spelljamming Helm. In the middle of the room is a gilded wooden throne with a cushioned seat and backrest covered in black velvet sewn with silver stars. This high-backed, 200-pound chair is the helm of the Scavenger, which was stolen by Halaster from the ship of the same name (see level 19, area 13). Sensors. Near the ceiling float four invisible scrying sensors created by the four ultroloths in area 21a using clairvoyance spells. If the ultroloths spot intruders in the room, they teleport to this location and attack.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HELM OF THE SCAVENGER</head><p>Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a spellcaster) This ornate chair is designed to propel and maneuver a ship through space. Passive Properties. The following properties of the helm come into play even when no creature is attuned to it:</p><p>• When placed aboard a vessel weighing between 1 and 100 tons, the helm generates an envelope of fresh air around the ship while it is in the void of space (but not underwater). This envelope extends out from the edges of the hull in all directions for a distance equal in length to the vessel's beam, so that creatures aboard and near the ship can breathe normally in space. The temperature within the air envelope is 70 degrees Fahrenheit. • When placed aboard a vessel weighing between 1 and 100 tons, the helm generates an artificial gravity field while the ship is in the void of space, so that creatures can walk on the ship's decks as they normally would.</p><p>Creatures and objects that fall overboard bob in a gravity plane that extends out from the main deck for a distance equal in length to the vessel's beam.</p><p>Active Properties. The sensation of being attuned to the helm is akin to being immersed in warm water. While attuned to the helm, you gain the following abilities while you sit in it:</p><p>• You can use the helm to propel the vessel across or through water and other liquids at a maximum speed in miles per hour equal to your highest-level unexpended spell slot. • You can use the helm to propel the vessel through air or space at a maximum speed in miles per hour equal to your highest-level unexpended spell slot x 10. • Provided you have at least one unexpended spell slot, you can steer the vessel, albeit in a somewhat clumsy fashion, in much the same way that oars or a rudder can maneuver a seafaring ship. </p></div>

Four ultroloths (each marked with a U on map 23) lurk in alcoves along the north and south walls of this 30-foot-high room. Glass-Covered Acid Pit. The floor is a 6-inch-thick sheet of transparent glass, below which is a 30-footdeep pit containing a 20-foot-deep pool of yellow acid. Visible through the churning, translucent acid are three I-foot-diameter pitted iron wheels affixed to the pit floor in a triangular formation. Secret Door. A secret door in the east wall is locked.</p><p>The ultroloths spend most of their time using clairvoyance spells to scry on area 20, but they emerge from their alcoves to attack anyone other than Halaster who enters this room. Their purpose here is to guard area 21b. The acid pit doesn't concern the ultroloths, since they have immunity to acid damage.</p><p>Each 10-foot-square section of glass floor has AC 13, a damage threshold of 10, 25 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Destroying three or more 10-foot-square sections causes the remainder of the glass floor to shatter, dropping all creatures standing on it into the acid. Any creature that enters the acid or starts its turn in it takes 33 (6d10) acid damage.</p><p>A character can use an action to try to turn one of the iron wheels at the bottom of the acid pit, doing so with a successful DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check. A wheel can also be turned by a character using a telekinesis spell or similarly powerful magic. Turning all three wheels unlocks the secret door to area 21b.</p><p>The secret door is above the acid and held shut by three internal sliding bolt locks, each of which is attached to one of the submerged iron wheels in the acid pit. In lieu of turning those wheels, characters need three separate knock spells to open the door (one per lock). The door can't be forced open otherwise. Once all three bolts are slid back, the door pushes open easily.</p></div>

Standing atop a raised stone dais in the middle of the room, facing the double door, is a life-size statue of Halaster, his arms raised before him and his face bearing an awkward smile. Rat. Gnawing on a piece of celery at the foot of the statue is an ordinary, harmless rat.</p><p>When he is not incapacitated, Halaster can touch the statue to teleport himself and anything he is wearing or carrying to a space within 5 feet of the statue in area 28 or the statue in area 33 (no action required).</p></div>

A creature that gazes into the mirror sees its reflection take the form of a female gnome in leather armor. She speaks Common and Gnomish, and is surprised to see the characters. Halaster trapped her in the mirror so Jong ago that she has lost track of time. The gnome has forgotten her name, after not interacting with other creatures for centuries. She longs to be free and asks the characters to help her.</p><p>The mirror is a Medium object with AC 11, 4 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Breaking it or casting a successful dispel magic spell (DC 19) on the mirror frees the gnome. However, without the mirror's magic to sustain her life, she instantly ages and dies, leaving nothing but dust, bones, and scraps of leather armor behind.</p></div>

Behind the cauldron rests a wooden This demilich is all that remains of Branta Myntion, a wizard who fell in with a bad crowd. Her hunger for magic set her on an evil path as she hunted down and killed other wizards to acquire their spellbooks. Before old age could claim her, Branta transformed herself into a lich. In this form , she came to Undermountain to plunder its magic. Halaster captured and enslaved her, promising to free her if she helped him brew potions. Tragically, that promise went unfulfilled.</p><p>Deprived of the ability to feed souls into her phylactery, which lies hidden in a dungeon far from Waterdeep, Branta's skeletal form deteriorated. Now, over a century later, only her skull remains. Years of captivity have driven the demilich insane, and it attacks anyone other than Halaster.</p><p>Although powerful wards prevent the demilich from leaving Halaster's tower, the tower is not considered its lair. Consequently, the demilich doesn't gain lair actions, nor does the tower exhibit the demilich's lair traits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CAULDRON</head><p>The cauldron is held aloft by magic, and the fire beneath it is also magical.

The cauldron contains twenty doses of a hot, oily black elixir that has grains of sand floating in it. A creature that imbibes a single dose of the liquid gains the ability to cast time stop once in the next 24 hours. A creature that imbibes multiple doses of the elixir gains the benefit of only the last dose consumed. One minute after it is removed from a heat source, the elixir cools and loses its magic.</p></div>

Each label bears Halaster's rune and the date 1531 DR.</p><p>A detect magic spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around one of the bottles. Uncorking this bottle causes an elder rune to appear in the air above it (see "Elder Runes," page 12). The rune targets the creature that opened the bottle. If the bottle was opened with a mage hand spell or similar magic, the rune targets the caster of the spell, provided the caster is within 60 feet of the opened bottle.

Carved into each stone are pictographs of primitive humans using spears to hunt reindeer and fend off yetis.</p><p>If a creature uses a finger or a staff to trace Halaster's rune on the surface of either of the standing stones, a gate forms between them and lasts for 1 minute. A legend lore spell or similar magic reveals the way to activate the gate, its destination, and the fact that it's one-way only.

It attacks any creature that enters the room unaccompanied by Halaster.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TREASURE</head><p>Following the destruction of Rantantar, one of his oldest apprentices, Halaster recovered the dead archmage's wand of wonder-only to discover that Rantantar had somehow bound his evil spirit inside it. The spirit can do nothing other than animate and discharge the wand, which currently has 7 charges. The animated wand has the statistics of a Tiny animated object (see the animate objects spell description in the Player's Handbook). As an action, the animated wand can expend 1 of its charges and target a random creature with one of its randomly determined effects. Any such effect that would target the wand's user targets the wand instead. If reduced to 0 hit points, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.</p><p>A dispel evil or good spell cast on the wand rids it of Rantantar's evil spirit, whereupon the wand clatters to the floor and becomes an inanimate wand of wonder. An antimagic field spell suppresses the wand's magic but doesn't oust the spirit lodged inside it.</p><p>If the animated wand is grabbed while Rantantar's spirit is lodged inside it, a contest of wills ensues. The creature grabbing the wand must immediately make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is forced to release the wand. On a successful save, the wand becomes inanimate until the creature lets go of it. If a spellcaster holds the wand long enough to become attuned to it, that act banishes Rantantar's evil spirit from the wand forever.</p></div>

A secret door in the northern alcove conceals a staircase that leads up to area 32.</p><p>The pentagram and the space above it (a cylinder 20 feet high and 40 feet in diameter) are contained within a permanent antimagic field (see the antimagic field spell description in the Player's Handbook for effects). This field prevents spells from detecting a magic item that is hidden beneath a secret trapdoor in the middle of the pentagram (see "Shield of the Uven Rune" below). A character who examines the floor inside the pentagram and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds the trapdoor, which is locked. A character can use thieves' tools to try to unlock the trapdoor, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check.</p></div>

You can transfer the shield's magic to a nonmagical weapon by tracing the uven rune on the weapon with one finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the shield is destroyed, and the rune is etched or burned into the chosen weapon. This weapon becomes a rare magic item that requires attunement. It has the properties of a +l weapon.

A character who examines the portraits and plaques can, with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (History) check, confirm that these are paintings of Halaster's original seven apprentices, showing them as they were before they descended into Undermountain and were overcome by madness.</p><p>Each apprentice is shown wearing a horned ring on one finger; these rings are identical and resemble the horned ring worn by Halaster. The other features of each portrait are as follows:</p><p>Rantanta r is a fat, frowning man scarred by fire. He wears ornate purple robes and grasps what looks like a wand of wonder in his burned right hand. Nester is a handsome, slender man with thinning hair and a penetrating stare. He wears a plain black robe and many rings on his steepled fingers. Tattooed on his forehead is a tiny black rune. A successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check confirms that the rune represents the School of Necromancy. Trobriand the Metal Mage is a stoic, bearded man with black hair, black robes, and tinker's goggles. Perched on his shoulder is a tiny iron scorpion. Muira l the Misshapen is an ugly, powerfully built man with messy brown hair and a cruel sneer. He wears battered plate armor and has a steel helm with a scorpion motif tucked under his right arm. Clutched in his left hand is a longsword that drips blood. Arcturia has straw-like hair, bony features, blue-tinged skin, and an exasperated expression. She wears a wide-brimmed conical hat and a robe of butterflies. She holds up a finger, above which floats a tiny, glowing sigil. A successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check confirms that the sigil represents the School of Transmutation. Marambra Nyghtsteel is a striking woman with long auburn hair and an empty, distant gaze. She wears a black robe and holds a staff topped with a rune. A successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check confirms that the rune represents the School of Evocation. Jhe siyra Kestellharp is a young, plain-looking woman dressed in yellow and blue robes.

In truth, these "paintings" are magical scrying sensors that are fixed on the following locations in Waterdeep: Characters acquainted with Waterdeep can easily recognize the locations being scried upon, since they are all prominent landmarks. Breaking a scrying device's frame or removing it from the wall destroys its magic.</p><p>Eight living unseen servants (see appendix A) are painting four new portraits of Halaster and carving a statue of him in this room.

Steps ascend to a raised alcove that contains a purple marble throne surrounded by stacks of aged books. Carved into the wall behind the throne is Halaster's personal rune, and beneath the rune is a locked iron chest. (Halaster s its in the throne and is invisible when the characters enter.) Statue. On the opposite side of the room from the throne is a life-size stone statue of a nude Halaster wearing a cowboy hat and riding a donkey. Magic Circle. Inscribed on the floor in the middle of the room is a 40-foot-diameter circle of glowing runes.</p><p>Halaster uses it to summon an empyrean who owes him a favor. (The circle serves no other purpose.)</p><p>When he is seated in the throne, Halaster remains invisible even while attacking or casting spells. When he sees one or more characters enter the room, he waves an invisible hand and causes the circle of runes on the floor to summon Nalkara (see "Na lkara the Empyrean" below). He then uses the power of the throne to throw his voice so that he doesn't betray his location when he speaks to the empyrean.</p><p>Halaster orders Nalkara to slay the characters, regardless of his feelings toward them. If the characters pass the test by defeating the empyrean, Halaster again uses the throne to throw his voice and congratulates them. His next actions depend on his current goal (see "Halaster's Goals," page 11):</p><p>• If the characters took any actions to further Ha laster's current goal, he greets them warmly, thanks them for their help, returns any magic items they sacrificed to reach this level (see area 35 on level 22), and allows them to leave his tower by way of the standing gate in area 36 (which he activates for them). The characters gain no XP for "defeating" Halaster in this fashion. If they refuse to leave, Halaster becomes annoyed and attacks them. • If the characters took any actions to hinder Halaster's current goal, the Mad Mage expresses his displeasure and attacks them.</p><p>Five minutes a fter Halaster dies, the demiplane containing his tower collapses, scattering its contents across the Astral Plane (see "Conclusion," page 302).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HALASTER'S ThRONE</head><p>The throne has the following magical properties:</p><p>• When seated in the throne, a creature can use a bonus action to turn invisible or to end the effect. The invisibility ends automatically when the creature is no longer seated in the throne. • A creature that speaks while seated in the throne can choose to throw its voice, making it seem to originate from any point in the room that the creature can see. When he is not incapacitated, Halaster can touch this statue to teleport himself and anything he is wearing or carrying to a space within 5 feet of the s tatue in area 22 or the statue in area 28 (no action required).</p></div>

Most of the books piled around the throne are worthless, rambling texts on the nature of magic and the multiverse. Among them are nine leather-bound spellbooks bearing Halaster's personal rune. Collectively, these spellbooks contain every spell on the wizard's spell list in the Player's Handbook. Individually, each book holds the spells of a specific level, 1st through 9th. Add spells from other sources you see fit.</p><p>Hidden in the cut-out pages of a leather-bound novel titled Longsaddle Sunset is a revolver loaded with six bullets (see "Firearms" in chapter 9 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).</p><p>The iron chest behind the throne has an arcane lock spell cast on it that Halaster alone can ignore. A knock spell or similar magic opens the chest, as does a successful DC 25 Dexterity check made by a character using thieves' tools. The chest contains a gold-plated herald's trumpet (250 gp); a coral beer stein painted with scenes of underwater life (500 gp); a cloak made of giant eagle feathers (750 gp); a delicate, multicolored, blownglass lily trimmed with gold (1,250 gp); and a rolled-up painting of the Battle of Emridy Meadows, a conflict that transpired on a distant world called Oerth (2,500 gp).</p></div>

Surmounting the saucer is a hinged metal dome that is opaque from the outside and transparent from the inside. The entrance to the cockpit is 10 feet off the floor when the saucer is landed.</p><p>The saucer is a Huge object with AC 19, 200 hit points, a flying speed of 60 feet, the ability to hover, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It is not airtight. Provided it has 50 or more hit points remaining, the saucer can be repaired as follows:</p><p>• Each casting of the mending cantrip restores 1 hit point to the damaged saucer . A character who has tinker's tools, proficiency in the Arcana skill, and 10 gp worth of replacement parts can spend 1 hour making repairs; at the end of the hour, the saucer regains ld4 hit points. The <ref type="table" target="#tab_75">dome covers a cockpit that contains a padded  leather seat and a slanted metal console.

The rod's normal magical properties are suppressed while it is attached to the flying saucer's console. The rod can be torn from the console by force with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. A character can also use thieves' tools or tinker's tools to detach the rod from the console or reattach it, which requires 1 minute and no ability check.

Against the far wall rests a padded workout bench and an iron barbell bearing 400 pounds of weight. Behind the bench, hanging on the wall, is a set of boxing gloves.</p><p>If a character uses any of the room's equipment, the nearest golem stops its workout and stands ready to assist. The golems attack only if damage causes them to go berserk.</p><p>If a character dons the boxing gloves, one golem moves to the middle of the room, raises its fists, and trades blows with anyone who tries to box with it.

As the tower is torn asunder, its contents are blasted into the far corners of the Astral Plane. Characters who are holding onto one another or are tethered together end up in the same place on the Astral Plane until they find a means of escape or until a githyanki-crewed astral warship stumbles upon them. See chapter 2 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information on the Astral Plane and its perils.</p><p>Halaster's death also deactivates all gates in Undermountain. These gates reactivate when the Mad Mage re-forms ldlO days later in a random dungeon location.</p><p>During Halaster's absence,Jhesiyra (see ''.Jhesiyra Kestellharp," page 10) tries to seize control of Undermountain. Does she succeed? That's up to you. If she is successful, Jhesiyra takes her place as the new master of the dungeon, and Ha laster does not return. Whether Jhesiyra remains disembodied or assumes a corporeal form when she usurps Halaster's control over Undermountain is also for you to decide, but one thing she won't do is reactivate Halaster's gates. She doesn't trust them and would prefer to create her own gates in due time. If Arcturia and Trobriand are still around,Jhesiyra plots to destroy them before they turn against her, and she might even draft adventurers to help her.</p><p>Existing in a disembodied state for so long has done little to preserve Jhesiyra's sanity, and it remains an open question whether Undermountain becomes a safer place with her in charge. In all likelihood, the dungeon will remain a perilous location, as Jhesiyra's fear that Halaster might someday return prompts her to ward the dungeon against that eventuality.</p><p>If Jhesiyra is unable to seize control of Undermountain, she continues to lurk in the dungeon as a disembodied entity, waiting for another opportunity to emerge. Unaware ofjhesiyra's attempt to dethrone him, Halaster re-forms in Undermountain as he has done many times before. He doesn't take being killed personally, but it inspires him to toughen Undermountain's defenses so that the next group of adventurers can't thwart him so easily. Much of his time in the coming months is spent creating a new demiplane and a new tower to replace the ones that were destroyed after he died.</p><p>KULLPORT IS A CRIM, CUTTHROAT OUTPOST OF civilization where adventurers can resupply and take refuge. Yet few souls of the surface world have any clue how to reach this shadowy reflection of Waterdeep, making any ta lk of the Port of Shadow akin to a rumor, or a warningwhich is just how its denizens like it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REACHING SKULLPORT</head><p>The routes by which adventurers can arrive at Skullport are described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THROUGH UNDERMOUNTAIN -----</head><p>Skullport is connected to level 3 of Undermountain by the underground River Sargauth and by five meandering subterranean passageways: Beggar's Rest Pass, Shadow Pass, S teamfall Pass, Taglath's Gap, and Whisperhaunt Pass. See maps 25 and 26 in this section for the locations of these routes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THROUGH THE SEA CAVES</head><p>-----------S k u 11 port can be reached by traveling through a series of natural caverns and magical locks that stretch from the South Sea Caves on Waterdeep's shore to the River Sargauth far below Mount Wate rdeep. Crashing waves and jagged rocks make the outermost of these flooded caves dangerous to navigate. Dozens of old ships lie wrecked within, their swollen hulks home to sea hags, merrows, and other aquatic creatures.</p><p>The waters grow calmer as one travels deeper into the mountain, where a series of magic locks control the water level. Vessels descend hundreds of feet as they pass between them. Where the locks end is a vast cavern containing a smooth stone retaining wall that rises 10 feet above the water's surface. The partially collapsed remnants of a te n-story-tall hoist loom above the retaining wall. This contraption was designed to lift a vessel of almost a ny size, swing it over the wall, and lower it down the other s ide to the River Sargauth 100 feet below. Skull port lies just a few hundred yards farther along the underground river. Time and neglect have rendered the hoist nonfunctional, thus preventing large ships from reaching the Port of Shadow. Many denizens of Skullport would like to fix it, but they lack the mutual trust and cooperation required for such a project to succeed. The absence of the hoist has n't stopped all manner of nefarious sorts from using their own ropes to haul rowboats and other small craft over the barrier wall.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SKULLPORT OVERVIEW</head><p>Skullport fills an immense cavern. The town has three levels: a lower level, a middle level, and a top level.

Above this labyrinth run mazes of catwalks made from the wood of old shipwrecks. Old rigging is used to suspend the creaky catwalks. • The 90-foot-high cavern ceiling is covered with a forest of stalactites. • Most of the lanterns that once illuminated Skullport are gone, turned to rust or stolen by thieves long ago. Denizens carry their own light sources or rely on darkvision to see. Flameskulls are often mistaken from a distance for bobbing torches as they drift through town.</p><p>The town has no general store, and some merchandise that is abundant in Waterdeep simply isn't available here.

Pirates once used the subterranean settlement as a trade port, but now it's a monster-infested haunt where spies and assassins hone their craft. Beware the fortress overlooking the river! Its garrison is commanded by an evil knight with a wyvern mount. Secret temples exist in great numbers in Undermountain, particularly those of evil gods not welcomed in the city above. The vile servants of these deities are locked in an endless war for supremacy in the dark dungeon.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WHAT DROW FEAR</head><p>Part of Undermountain was carved out by the drow. Muiral, said to be a former bodyguard and apprentice of Halaster's , claims this domain and hunts trespassers for sport. These halls are littered with the bones of the slaughtered. Even the dark elves speak of Muiral in hushed tones. Anyone who can terrify the drow should be avoided at all costs. Much of Undermountain was built long ago by the shield dwarves of the Melairkyn clan. These dwarves were masters of stonework and hid many of their rooms behind secret doors. They also dug deep in search of precious metals. These mines were later stripped by duergar invaders, leaving a maze of worthless tunnels and caverns for monsters to inhabit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SCHOOL OF MAGIC</head><p>Rumor has it that a wizards' academy has opened on one of Undermountain's levels. It's not known who runs this academy-perhaps one of Halaster's apprentices or the Mad Mage himself-but many mages have been drawn down to it. What wizard wouldn't want to glimpse the powerful magic gathering dust in the depths of Undermountain? = MAD HOUSE The Shadowdusks were a Waterdavian noble family whose quest for political supremacy •ended centuries ago after Shadowdusk wizards opened portals to the Far Realm. Twisted by madness and driven from their home, they sought assistance from Halaster and sank into the depths of Undermountain, never to be seen again-yet vestiges of the noble house undoubtedly remain. This vessel could travel below the waves and through the air. No one has seen it in years. Perhaps it sank or was lost in the starry maelstrom of the night sky, but divination spells suggest it found its way into Undermountain. Others have searched for it below Waterdeep, but no one has found it and lived to tell the tale. The Mad Mage has transformed an entire level of Undermountain into a proving ground for adventurers who seek to reach the deepest layers of the dungeon and the treasures hidden within. At the end of this underground obstacle course waits the greatest challenge of all: Netherskull the Death Tyrant, an undead beholder that hates wizards above all.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NESTER'S FAT E</head><p>Halaster brought seven apprentices with him to Undermountain. One of them, Nester, became a lich using spells and methods of his own devising. But his process was flawed, and over time Nester's phylactery and body disintegrated until only his floating skull and skeletal arms remained. Driven mad by his failure to achieve true lichdom, Nester continues to haunt Undermountain in this weakened form.  Waterdeep was erected atop the bones of a dwarven kingdom built on the dust of a much older elven kingdom. It is said that a relic of the elves still waits to be found in Undermountain: a magic sword so sharp that its edge can slice through stone. Many adventurers have vanished during their hunt for the weapon, which, it is said, the elves blessed with the heart of a warrior and the soul of a poet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GITH WHO'S COMING T O DINNER?</head><p>Githyanki have invaded Undermountain. Perhaps they seek to destroy a mind flayer colony hidden in the depths of the dungeon, or perhaps they are planning to attack and plunder Waterdeep. There's one other possibility: the githyanki might be building a creche-a stronghold away from the timeless Astral Plane where they can raise their young and train them in the art of war. Deep within Undermountain is a vast cavern containing a giant stalagmite that has been hollowed out to serve as a wizard's tower, perhaps even a refuge for the Mad Mage himself. The tower is guarded by stone constructs. No one knows what dwells inside. Not far from this tower lurks a most peculiar creature: a giant snail with a shell of pure gold.</p></div>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_3"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>birthed out of a conflict with the gods. Others give Halaster less ancient origins, placing him among the early wizards of Netheril, or asserting that he came from a southern nation long since buried by sand and time. Whatever his origin, scholars have recorded that Halaster brought with him seven apprentices to Mount Waterdeep. With the Seven guarding his back, Halaster tapped into his immense power to summon beings from other planes of existence to help him build a wizard's tower to dwarf all other wizard's towers. But as the seasons wore on, the Seven saw less and less of their enigmatic master. Halaster continued to use fell creatures from distant planes for tunneling and other construction beneath his tower, and the wizard kept the nature of most of his underground dealings a secret from the Seven. Eventually, Halaster's exploration broke into the Underhalls, a complex of tunnels and rooms built by the dwarves around a mithral mine beneath Mount Waterdeep. The architects of the Underhalls, the Melairkyn clan, had long ago been killed or dispersed, and warring duergar and drow had settled in the ruins. Halaster began a crusade against both the drow and the duergar, participating in wild hunts with extraplanar allies through the tunnels. The stubborn duergar dug in until the mithral was largely mined out; then they abandoned the Underhalls, leaving the drow to fight Halaster and his minions alone. The Mad Mage rounded up the remaining dark elves, trapping some of their souls for use in his dark magic, while twisting the bodies and enslaving the minds of others. Once he had wrung the drow of their usefulness, Halaster Blackcloak tunneled on, ever downward, indulging his inexplicable compulsion for delving deeper and deeper into the mountain. Using his underground complex as a base of operations, Halaster traveled to other planes and distant lands, collecting strange and dangerous creatures to live as prisoners, servants, or guardians in Undermountain. Populating and defending the dungeon became an obsession. Over time, the mage's preoccupation with Undermountain electrified his eccentricities and infused him with an air of unconcealable madness. Halaster's apprentices came and went. Some left only to returninexplicably drawn down into Undermountain's depths. Others remained by his s ide. As they began dedicating more attention to their private obsessions, madness settled into their souls as well. During the years Halaster quested on other planes and sequestered himself in his tunnels, his magnificent tower and its surrounding walls fell into ruin. In time, the city now known as Waterdeep developed in the shadow of Mount Waterdeep and spread down to the harbor. As the city sprawled outward over the years, it UNDERM OUNTAIN O VERVIEW A KNOT IN THE W EAVE Where Waterdeep stands today, there once stood Aelinthaldaar, the capital city of the ancient elven kingdom of lllefarn.</figDesc></figure>

The knot permeates Undermountain, and the madness it causes typically manifests as an obsession with the dungeon itself. Those affected by the knot in the Weave exhibit a subconscious desire to remain in or near the dungeon. Halaster and several of his apprentices fell prey to this obsession, as did many Melairkyn dwarves and Durnan, the proprietor of the Yawning Portal. Not all creatures that dwell in Undermountain succumb to its madness, and those who do aren't even aware that the dungeon has them in its clutches.</figDesc></figure>

Jhesiyra can't stop characters from moving between dungeon levels by more conventional means.

The blocks are not lit when the characters first arrive, but pulling a lever in area 37 causes each block to s hed colorful light as bright as that created by a continual flame spell. Maddgoth's magic keeps the temperature inside the castle steady at 70 degrees Fahrenheit, but characters can shut off the heat by pulling another lever in area 37. Exterior doors are made of stone with adamantine hinges, and, like the castle walls, are impervious to damage. Interior doors look like fa ncy stained glass windows with iron hinges on one side. Each one is fitted with panes of colored glass set in an iron framework. The door handles are likewise fash ioned from iron. A locked interior door can be forced open with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. Its lock can also be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Shattering a door's glass panes creates an opening large enough for a creature to fit through. Characters near the castle and inside it are shrunk to one-twelfth their normal size a long with their gear. Almost everything they encounter inside the castle is similarly reduced in size, creating a sense of normalcy. Maddgoth's homunculus and Otto the faerie dragon are noteworthy exceptions; use their modified statistics for encounters in the castle.</figDesc></figure>

The doll on the floor represents Yarek, the student recently killed by the bone devil in area 48.

Embedded in the stuffed chest of each doll is one of the night hag's toenail clippings, signifying and enabling her secret power over the individual represented by the doll. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check can ascertain that the way to rob this power is by replacing the hag's nail clipping with a piece of the character's own body. Doing so enables the character to use the effigy to visit harm upon the student it represents. For a doll to function, both it and the creature it represents must be in Undermountain.

Eight lifelike statues of drow warriors, four males and four females, are positioned around the room. (The statues are eight drow turned to stone by Muiral's magic.) If Muira l (see appendix A) is here, he's lurking in the space between the spider sculpture and the ceiling, roughly 30 feet above the floor. Upon detecting intruders, he casts animate objects on five of the drow statues and commands them to attack while he bides above the giant spider sculpture. If the animated drow statues are destroyed, Muiral casts wall of force to attempt to separate one character from the others before crawling down to attack his lone prey. Destroying five legs of the spider sculpture causes it to break free of the ceiling and crash to the floor. Each leg has AC 17; 25 hit points; resistance to acid, cold, and fire damage; immunity to poison and psychic damage; and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons that aren't adamantine. Any creature underneath the sculpture when it falls must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12dl0) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Casting a greater restoration spell or similar magic on a petrified drow restores it to flesh, provided the statue has not been destroyed. Drow restored in this manner have two goals: s lay Muiral, and report back to their superior, Zress Orlezziir. The males are named Dhuurak, jaratlab, Quenmourn, and Seldax.

Crowning the platform are three spherical turrets, each with a brass nozzle. The entire construction stands 20 feet tall. The control module is a chamber obscured from view in the center of the contraption, nestled between the three turrets. Shockerstomper has blindsight out to a range of 60 feet and is blind beyond this radius. It activates when a creature comes within 60 feet of it. Once it is activated, Shockerstomper attempts to destroy all creatures in the cavern. It can't pursue creatures beyond the cavern, because it's too big to fit through the exit. The characters earn 11,500 XP for disabling or defeating it. Shockerstomper is a Gargantuan construct with immunity to poison and psychic damage, as well as the blinded, deafened, charmed, frightened, paralyzed, and poisoned conditions. It has a walking speed of 40 feet. Its main body (saucer and turrets) has AC 18 and 300 hit points. Its legs can be attacked separately; each leg has AC 20 and 50 hit points. When a leg drops to 0 hit points, it is disabled, and Shockerstomper can use a reaction to detach it from its main body. Whenever one of its legs is disabled, Shockerstomper's walking speed is reduced by 10 feet. The whole contraption topples over and shuts down if four of its seven legs are disabled.

Fidelio's ghost is looking for a potential host who is willing to be possessed by it. A character who allows the possession forgoes the saving throw to resist the effect, and you can allow the player to continue running the character. While possessed, the character gains the following flaw, which supersedes any conflicting personality trait: "I, Fidelio, favored son ofTyr, must strike down Netherskull at all costs, as justice demands." The character also reeks of cheap cologne while possessed. His arrogance aside, Fidelio won't possess a humanoid without its consent. If it can't find a willing host, it offers to join the party on two conditions: the characters must seek out Netherskull with haste, combat it, and allow Fidelio to deal the death blow to it. The ghost knows the location of the death tyrant's lair (area 39c) but doesn't know how to open the doors that lead to it, or about the secret way in (area 39b). If Netherskull is reduced to 0 hit points by a creature other than Fidelio's ghost or its host, the paladin of Tyr can't accept that someone other than he dealt the killing blow. The ghost wallows in despair, doomed to haunt the Obstacle Course until another follower of Tyr convinces it to move on with a successful DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check. A non-follower can attempt the check, but only by posing as a Tyr worshiper and fooling the ghost with a successful DC 10 Charisma (Deception) check. If it succeeds in reducing Netherskull to 0 hit points, either as a ghost or when in possession of a host, Fidelio's ghost is laid to rest. "Victory at last!" says the ghost as it fades away. Afterward, Tyr bestows a blessing of protection (see "Supernatural Gifts" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) on any character who served as Fidelio's host. For laying Fidelio's spirit to rest, the characters should receive XP as if they had defeated the ghost in combat.</figDesc></figure>

This bridge provides a relatively safe means of crossingthe chasm, particularly given that the chasm suppresses fly spells and similar magic (see area 40). The bridge, suspended 30 feet above the surface of the lava, is flat , translucent, and without railings. Normally, it is solid and safe to walk on-but any section of the bridge within 10 feet of a magic item becomes insubstantial. A creature or object passes through an insubstantial section of the bridge like it's not there. A successful dispel magic spell cast on the bridge (DC 18) causes the entire span to disappear for 1 hour. ln order to retain their magic items as they cross the bridge, the characters must devise a way to distance the items from the bridge as they cross it, such as by tying the items to ropes and dangling them more than 10 feet from the span.

It was captured while it searched this level for its companions, Tel'zact and Yeluit (see area 29c). Marquox doesn't know why the githyanki are keeping it alive, but it knows it won't survive long in their captivity. If the characters don't attack it at once, Marquox proposes a deal. If they free it and help it rescue its companions, Marquox guarantees the party safe passage through level 17. A successful DC 16 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that the illithid has no intention of making good on its promise. If the githzerai zerths from level are with the party, they refuse to help the mind flayer and insist that the characters kill it. If the characters choose Marquox over them, the githzerai abandon the party and withdraw to level 15. Marquox knows about Stardock but has never visited the asteroid. It also knows that the gate to Stardock is in area 11 , and that a black crystal rod is needed to activate it.

Left undisturbed, two female githyanki knights argue quietly with one another in the middle of the room. One of the knights has a decapitated mind flayer head hanging from her belt. The older githyanki knight, Yaveklar, commands the githyanki forces on this level. Though she is eager to slay the ulitharid and wipe out the mind flayer colony, Yaveklar is cautious and patient. She has suffered more losses than her superiors would consider acceptable, so she's waiting for reinforcements before launching any further assaults. The younger knight, Lashiir, stands ready to take over in the event that Yaveklar is removed from command. Lashiir is proposing to attack the neothelid in area 8, using misty step spells to bypass the walls of force containing it. Yaveklar is not convinced that her forces are strong enough to defeat the neothelid and still maintain a foothold on this level. If the characters can communicate with the knights, they can attempt to forge a truce with the githyanki. Yaveklar orders them to slay the neothelid as proof of their worth. If the characters kill the neothelid but return to Yaveklar in a very weakened state, she takes advantage of their situation and tries to finish them off. If they kill the creature and return with strength to spare, Yaveklar agrees to let them travel through Seadeeps unmolested and will even commit forces to a joint operation to conquer the mind flayer colony. IfYaveklar is neutralized, Lashiir readily fills the power vacuum and behaves much like her predecessor. The illithid head dangling from Yaveklar's belt is a trophy from a recent skirmish.

Although Extremiton has created an impressive facs imile, characters who are drawn into the environment notice slight discrepancies in the way familiar NPCs act, or pick up on minor details that the ulitharid has gotten wrong or can't reasonably duplicate: slight changes in decor, books that are blank between the covers, fou l-tasting elven wine, dwarves unable to speak Dwarvish, and so on. As soon as a character encounters such a discrepancy, the ulitharid also becomes aware of it, since their minds are linked. When confronted with an error, Extremiton either ta kes steps to correct it or tries to draw attention away from it. For example, it doesn't know Dwarvish well enough to cause the residents of Alterdeep to speak it fluently, so it might subtly remove all known Dwarvish-speaking characters from the simulation until its familiarity with that language improves significantly. The Yawning Portal. The most accurate and fleshed -out location in Alterdeep is the Yawning Portal. Extremiton is particularly fascinated with the establishment, its owner, and its clientele. Most newcomers to the simulation awaken here, and Extremiton tries to create enough situa• tions of interest in the tavern to keep its captive audience engaged. Extremiton appears in the Yawning Portal as its</figDesc></figure>

Creatures immune to psychic damage can't be killed by this kind of system shock and stabilize auto• matically inside the simulation. Leaving Alterdeep. If characters in the simulation try to escape Alterdeep's city limits, Extremiton creates situations to dissuade them: bad weather, a city-wide lockdown, a festival-whatever it takes. The ulitharid hasn't researched areas outlying the city. Consequently, nothing but thick fog lies beyond the city gates. The same is true for Alterdeep's version ofUndermountain; characters who descend the well in the Yawning Portal taproom find themselves en• shrouded in fog with nowhere to go but back up. Extremiton, in the guise of Durnan, discourages exploration of Un• dermountain by claiming that the Mad Mage has magically sealed it off. Characters who are brought into the simulation can es• cape only if Extremiton allows it or if their psi pods are shut down. The ulitharid might remove one or more characters from the simulation if it finds them too disruptive, in which case they're taken out of their psi pods and confined to area 10 until they can be fed to the neothelid in area 8. The characters can also try to form an alliance with the ulitharid. Ex• tremiton might release them if. in exchange, they promise to destroy the githyanki that are threatening the mind flayer colony. You can roleplay these interactions or have the characters make ability checks to convince Extremiton to let them back into the rea l world.</figDesc></figure>

Before it turned to a life of space piracy, N'ghathrod lived in a mind flayer colony on the ringed planet of Glyth, which is farther from the sun than Toril. A few weeks after the Scavenger became trapped in Undermountain, N'ghathrod turned on its orog crew out of hunger, killing four of them and eating their brains. The remaining orog crew members fled to avoid a similar fate. The arrival of adventurers provides N'ghathrod with an unexpected but welcome food source. It tries to separate one party member from the others with a wall of force spell. It then uses its Mind Blast to stun its prey as a prelude to extracting its brain. If N'ghathrod is reduced to 55 hit points or fewer, its survival instinct supersedes its hunger, prompting it to surrender telepathically. The mind flayer apologizes for its assault and proposes an end to hostilities. Given a chance, it recounts how the Scavenger was orbiting Tori I when it was pulled through a magic gate to its current location. It also reveals that the ship's spelljamming helm vanished shortly thereafter (spirited away by a wish spell, though the mind flayer doesn't know it). If the mind flayer and the characters establish a truce, N'ghathrod offers to "guard the ship" while the characters set out to retrieve the stolen helm.

Raxxus serves as the planetar's executioner, ready to step forward and s lay whatever Fazrian commands it to kill. Raxxus can summon other yugoloths (as described inthe "Variant: Yugoloth Summoning" sidebar in the "Yugoloths" entry in the Monster Manual) and tries to do so if reinforcements are needed. Characters who defeat the planetar can tempt Raxxus with a bribe. Treasure in the amount of 10,000 gp or more can change the nycaloth's attitude toward the party from hostile to indifferent; treasure in the amount of 25,000 gp or more changes its attitude to friendly. Raxxus won't hurt the characters if it's indifferent toward them and helps the characters if it's friendly toward them. The nycaloth's disposition reverts to hostile if the characters threaten it or fail to make payment in a reasonable amount of time. Standing Gate to L• evel 19. The crystal menhirs are indestructible and form one of Halaster's magic gates (see "Gates," page 12). Striking either menhir with a hard object or targeting one or both with a shatter spell deals no damage, but causes an affected standing stone to emit a loud ringing that awakens the marilith demon inside. Nothing else causes these demons to awaken. The first thing an awakened marilith does is free itself using its Teleport action option. The mariliths are hostile toward all creatures that aren't demons, and they despise angels most of all. If a marilith is released in Fazrian's presence, the de mon and the angel fight until only one is left standing. If the planetar is forced to fight one marilith by itself, assume that Fazrian emerges victorious with 60 hit points remaining. If forced to fight both mariliths by itself, Fazrian is killed and each demon is left with 60 hit points. After being released from its menhir, a marilith can be magically compelled to divulge the command word that activates the gate. A legend lore spell or similar magic a lso reveals the command word. The current command word is "Yuraj," but Halaster changes it every few days. The rules of this gate are as follows:</figDesc></figure>

The room is empty except for a steel shield hanging on the south wall. The shield is cast in the form of a serene, angelic visage wreathed in bronze feathers. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around the otherwise ordinary shield, inside which is trapped a pit fiend named Kastzanedes. Any ability that detects the presence of fiends, such as a paladin's Divine Sense class feature, reveals the presence of such a creature bound within the shield. If an identify spell is cast on the shield, or if it is brought within 10 feet of its sister shield in area 9b, the pit fiend is released. It appears within 5 feet of the shield's bearer or in the nearest unoccupied space. The freed pit fiend attacks any other creatures it can see, targeting celestials above all others. While trapped in the shield, the pit fiend can communicate telepathically with the shield's wielder. It pretends to be a sentient magic item that is unwilling to disclose its secrets, trying to goad the characters into casting identify on it. If that tactic doesn't work, the pit fiend tries to talk the shield's wielder into undertaking a quest to find its sister shield. The pit fiend suspects that the other shield is nearby, but does not know its location. 6c . COMPONENTSSTOREROOM</figDesc></figure>

Those the creature has contacted know nothing of the ulitharid's true nature, only that an alien intellect has reached out to them for information. Word of these telepathic intrus ions has begun to spread throughout the city, gaining traction as more than just a mad rumor. Several of Durnan's regular patrons have spoken at length about it, and Durnan believes the source might be somewhere in Undermountain. In fact, he thinks a horrific, psionic monster called an elder brain might be lurking in the dungeon. Not wanting to alarm anyone with rumors of mind flayers, he keeps this conjecture to himself for now. Durnan urges adventurers to find the source of the telepathic contact, learn its intentions, and put a quick and decisive end to it if those intentions are hostile.

The walls of the shop on the other side of the door have caved in, and the space that remains is filled with piles of junk and well-worn adventuring gear. The shop's proprietor is an oni disguised as an old hobgoblin named Kinrob. If a character is looking to procure an item on the Adventuring Gear table or the Tools table in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook, there's a 25 percent chance that Kinrob has the item in question and will trade it for one or more items of equal or greater value. Kinrob's true nature is a well-known "secret" in the Legion of Azrok, and fear of the oni has rendered the surrounding neighborhood a ghost town. Azrok placates the oni by giving it newborn goblins to feed on. The first time the characters visit Kin rob, a bugbear enters to deliver a goblin child in a basket, then skulks away.

Darribeth desperately wants to get back to herwife Urgala, whom she hasn't seen in a decade. When last they were together, Urgala and Darribeth were living in Amphail, a town north of Waterdeep. In the intervening years, Urgala moved farther north to the frontier town of Triboar, where she took over a modest inn called Northshield House. (See the adventure Storm King's Thunder for more information on Urgala Meltimer and her inn.) If her sanity is restored, Darribeth becomes her normal self-a curious and kind woman with a flair for magic who doesn't mind bending rules for the greater good. She speaks Common, Dwarvish, Halfling, and Undercommon. Darribeth has a rope of climbing that belonged to a colleague who perished in the Underdark. She offers it as payment for getting her back to the surface. In addition, if any wizards are among her rescuers, she lets them copy spells from her spellbook (see "Treasure" below). Once restored to her right mind and borne safely to Waterdeep, Darribeth makes plans to return to Amphail. There, she learns what became of her wife and reunites with Urgala in Triboar. If the characters make the journey with Darribeth and all is well at Northshield House, Urgala is so delighted by their act of kindness that she offers them free room and board for as long as the inn remains standing. Urgala and Darribeth remain lifelong friends of the characters henceforth.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

Determined to keep Wyllow in Undermountain, Halaster used several wish spells to create a magical forest for her, but even this gift wasn't enough to offset the druid's languor. When Yinark forbade her from ever returning to the surface, Wyllow grew positively despondent. The relationship soured and turned violent. A volley of spells on both sides resulted in Yinark's death. After Wyllow' s fury abated, all that remained was undying grief and encroaching madness. She remains in Undermountain in accordance with Yinark's wishes, a prisoner of her own guilt. Undermountain is Wyllow's home now, and all memory of the surface world has faded from her mind. She is distant but kind toward those who pass harmlessly through her domain, but turns violent whenever her forest or its peaceful denizens are threatened. Before setting out to destroy interlopers, she rallies the green dragon and the werebats, using them to soften up her adversaries. She can also summon six awakened trees from the forest with a whistle. Wyllow's displacer beast companion, Crissann, is named after a human mercenary whom the elf befriended many years ago. Before this friendship could blossom into a romance, Halaster intervened and used his magic to turn Wyllow's new friend against her. The heartbroken druid slew Crissann in the woods with the help of several forest creatures and vowed never to let another mortal touch her heart so deeply. Wyllow has conflicted feelings about Halaster. She is grateful to him for providing her a home and keeping Wyllowwood alive with his magic, but she blames him for Yinark's death. She also pities him, for the Mad Mage too appears to be trapped in a prison of his own making. Wyllow believes he is no longer human, but an immortal entity composed of pure magic. Thus, she has given up any hope of being rid of him.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

The village and its environs stood empty for years until a congregation of goblin werebatstook residence in the caves around the buildings. The werebats prefer the dank caves to the structures, which have largely remained abandoned. Wyllow allows the werebats to feed on stray vermin and adventurers.

D EATH OF A NAGA The phantasmal scene of a spirit naga battling four yuan-ti purebloods plays out for characters who set foot on this island. As characters view the scene, they find themselves literally being drawn into it. Each character drawn into the scene temporarily becomes one of the yuan-ti fighting the wounded Hexacali. The character gains the statistics of a yuan-ti pureblood with 2d20 hit points remaining. Hexacali, a spirit na ga with 3S hit points, is trapped on the island and fights yuan-ti characters to the death. Yuan-ti characters who drop to 0 hit points during this fight immediately come to their senses and take 22 (4d10) psychic damage from the shock of their illusory demise. Unlike any damage sustained in the battle, this psychic damage is real. A character free of the vision can free another character from it by using an action to shake or slap them.

A string of military defeats has left Erelal in no mood to entertain visitors, and her brother has yet to make good on his promise to enslave the minotaurs of the Maze Level. Visitors who have business or grievances with Erelal are dealt with as quickly as possible. Those who come to her with frivolous affairs are scolded, threatened, and sent away with a stern warning not to trouble her again. If she is threatened, Erelal tries to summon a yochlol demon to defend her. If the shrine of Lolth in this chamber is intact, the demon summoning has a 90 percent chance of success. Erelal then hinders her enemies with a darkness spell before taking the safest exit. Giant spiders that she summons with the conjure animals spell use their blindsight to target enemies that are engulfed in magical darkness. If her defeat is inevitable and escape proves impossible, Erelal makes whatever concessions she must to save herself and her unborn child. Erelal's older brother is clad in a long gray robe with black, web-like tracery. Drivvin has convinced his sister that he has the power to enslave the minotaurs, which would enable House Freth to defeat the forces of House Auvryndar and secure its power in Undermountain.</figDesc><table /><note>But, having realized that he can't summon a goristro demon alone, the archmage understands that accepting Halaster's offer and his promise of assistance is the only way his plan will succeed.

Ezzat's pseudodragon companion, lpses, gathers up Runestone fragments as it hunts for food around the stalagmite, but a few occasionally escape its notice. A character who examines the cavern floor around the spire with a detect magic spell finds l d4 fragments. Without such magical aid, a character can find one fragment with a 1-hour search and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check.

Their houses were destroyed long ago. They have spent the last fifty years imprisoned by Ezzat, thirsting for blood. Neither Sabatene nor Tebran can enter the stalagmite without Ezzat's invitation, since the tower is his residence. Far removed from their resting places, they have nowhere to go if their physical forms are destroyed. A drow vampire reduced to 72 hit points or fewer attempts to flee rather than risk destruction.

A good-aligned human priest discouraged him from pursuing that evil path. After his priest friend died of old age and Ezzat became a lich to avoid a similar fate, he became obsessed with finding a way• not only to destroy Halaster but to gain control over Undermountain. Ezzat is a lich who speaks Common, Dwarvish, Draconic, Elvish, Sylvan, and Undercommon. He plans to destroy Halaster when he's good and ready. Until then, he'd rather not be disturbed. If the characters ask for help in destroying Halaster, the lich shares what he knows about the Mad Mage but declines to aid them in any other way. Assume that Ezzat knows all the information about Halaster given in appendix A, including the Mad Mage's lair actions and regional effects, but not his statistics. If the characters appear intent on destroying Ezzat, the lich accuses them of being the unwitting tools of the Mad Mage. He uses all the magic at his disposal to get rid of them.

The characters gain no XP for defeating Ezzat unless they also destroy the lich's phylactery (located in area 23). Ezzat has the forcecage spell prepared instead of plane shift, and he wears an amulet of proof against detection and location that conceals him from divination magic and scrying sensors. Ezzat's pseudodragon is selfish and doesn't like sharing its master with strangers. The lich lets the pseudodragon out of the tower once a day so that it can catch food and scour the cavern floor for Runestone fragments (see "Capturing lpses," page 261). Ezzat enjoys the pseudodragon's company but does not need its assistance in battle. If a fight breaks out, lpses settles atop the lintel of the nearest door and tries to stay out of harm's way. It has little cause to fear for the destruction of its master as long as Ezzat's phylactery remains secure in area 23. Ipses won't willingly betray Ezzat by divulging the phylactery's location.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

Phylactery. Lying in the middle of the floor is a small ornate metal box (Ezzat's phylactery). Ezzat recently summoned the marilith to guard his phylactery. A geas spell cast on it by the lich requires the demon to protect the phylactery against theft or destruction. The marilith takes out its frustration at being stuck here• by attacking intruders. If a character snatches the phylactery and flees, the marilith tries to pursue so as to avoid taking psychic damage from Ezzat's geas spell. The s tone plug in the floor is too heavy for the marilith to lift. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic radiating from the walls, which have more than six hundred Runestone fragments embedded in them. Each fragment extends the duration of the geas spell affecting the marilith by 30 days. The Runestone fragments disappear if the spell ends, their magic spent. The Runestone fragments can't be pried from the walls, since the same magic that protects the stalagmite tower from damage prevents their removal.</figDesc><table><row><cell>PHYLACTERY</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>

Blue sapphires glitter in the dwarves' eyes. Double Door. The doors in the east wall stand 18 feet high, a carving of a mighty waterfall spanning their surfaces. Mithra! inlays make the carved falls look like they are running with molten metal. Curtain. A 40-foot-long, 20-foot-high curtain of black dragon scales hangs from an iron rod bolted to the west wall. (The scales have become brittle with age and are not valuable.) Hanging Horn. Suspended from the ceiling by iron chains is a 20-foot-long iron horn with etched Dwarvish runes coiling around it.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

Dozens of iron masks hang from hooks on the southeast wall (see "Iron Masks" below). Other Furnishings. Against the northwest wall stands a low double bed. In the middle of the room, a locked iron strongbox rests atop a low marble table flanked by two stone chairs. Valtagar magically increases in size. While enlarged, Valtagar is Large, doubles his damage dice on Strength-based weapon attacks, and makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws with advantage. lfValtagar lacks the space to become large, he attains the maximum size possible in the space available. Valtagar magically turns invisible for up to 1 hour or until he attacks, he casts a spell, he uses his Enlarge, or his concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment he wears or carries is invisible with him. Archmages are exceedingly rare in duergar society, and Valtagar's gift for wizardry never sat well with the clans of Gracklstugh. He doesn't put himself in harm's way unless he has a clear tactical edge. If the characters threaten him after they gain entry to his quarters, he orders his golem to attack while he grabs his spellbook off the lectern, casts teleport, and joins his wife in area 18d. Valtagar has faced adventurers before and has a healthy fear of them. If the characters are willing to engage in civil discourse, he tries to hire them to slay Fazrian. The patience of his duergar followers is wearing thin, and he loses nothing by setting the adventurers loose against the planetar. In exchange, Valtagar guarantees safe passage through his domain whenever they need it and promises to tell them the location of a secret staircase that descends to the next level of Undermountain (see area 19a). To establish trust, he tells them about the secret vault hidden behind Fazrian's throne (see area 24) and shares what he knows about Fazrian and its allies:</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell>• A powerful cleric summoned a celestial being of im-</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>mense power named Fazrian, then directed it to slay a</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>host of monsters that once haunted the Deep Mines.</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>• That act of slaughter corrupted Fazrian.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LEVEL18:VANRAK DOOM ANRAKDOOM JS DESIGNED FOR FOUR 15TH-LEVEL</head><p>characters, and those who defeat the monsters on this level should gain enough XP to advance halfway to 16th level. The level is named after Vanrak Moonstar, a Waterdavian noble who turned to the worship of Shar (god of darkness and loss), descended into Undermountain, and became a death knight. To grasp what's happening on this level and why, one needs to know the fate that befell Lord Moonstar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE DARK FATE OF LORD VANRAK MOONSTAR</head><p>Adherents of Shar have been active in the shadow of Mount Waterdeep ever since a disastrous expedition to the BlackJungles mounted in the Year of the Dark Dawn (1104 DR) by Lord Vanrak Moonstar, a charismatic, outgoing swashbuckler. Vanrak was but a pale shadow of his former self when he returned. A few tendays later, his father, Lord Andvarran Moonstar, the family patriarch, died of a strange wasting disease that could not be cured by healing magic.</p><p>Upon assuming leadership of House Moonstar, Vanrak publicly broke with the temple of SelOne (god of the moon), which he blamed for his father's untimely death. Consumed with bitterness, the Dark Ranger, as Vanrak came to be known, secretly embraced SelOne's sister: Shar, the Lady of Loss.</p><p>By the Year of the Howling Moon (1130 DR), House Moonstar was in open schism. Family members who still venerated Selfine aligned themselves with Lord Vanrak's sister, Lady Alathene, and Selfme's priesthood. Meanwhile, Lord Vanrak and his followers extended their dark influence over much of the city's harbor with the aid of a small army of mercenaries bolstered by followers of Shar.</p><p>Lady Alathene appeared in open court and asked the Lords of Waterdeep to strip her brother of his title and banish him from the city. She a lso presented evidence of her brother's numerous crimes, including slavery, a rs on, theft, and murder. The Lords ordered the immediate capture of the Dark Ranger, but by the time the City Watch had breached the gates of his villa, Vanrak and his followers had already fled through a secret portal into Undermountain. He and his followers remained there until, in the Year of the Dark Mask (1171 DR), they conquered the level of Undermountain that came to be known as Vanrakdoom.</p><p>Operating from his new base, Vanrak extended his influence throughout much of Undermountain and even periodically dispatched elite strike teams to battle followers of SelOne in the city above. He achieved his most dramatic success in the Year of the Tomb (1182 DR), when his followers infiltrated the High House of Stars through its cellars, slaughtered most of the inhabitants before they could raise an alarm, engulfed the temple in black fire, and burned it to the ground. The invaders also acquired enough treasure from the temple vaults to fund Lord Vanrak's personal quest for immortality. Within a few years, the Dark Ranger had transformed himself into a death knight. <ref type="table">Moonstar as a skeletal  death knight, riding on the back of Umbraxakar, the  shadow dragon. Lying at the dragon's feet are piles of  withered corpses with hideous s hadows hovering ove r  them. Characters who examine the mural closely and  succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notice four !-inch-diameter holes bored into some of the  corpses. Keresta uses these holes to pass through the  wall in mist form.</ref> Secret Door. The mural covers a stone secret door functionally identical to the one in area 30a.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The mural depicts Lord Vanrak</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="32.">UMBRAXAKAR'S LAIR</head><p>Umbraxakar the shadow dragon dwells here and cannot be surprised by the characters, whose presence he has sensed since they first stepped into the Shadowfell.</p><p>Characters who experienced the vision in area 17 recognize this hall as the same one seen in that vision. The hall contains the following:</p><p>Shadows. The 40-foot-high vaulted ceiling is buttressed by eight stone columns, around which gather eleven shadows and four shadow assassins (see appendix A) under Umbraxakar's command. (These undead act immediately after the dragon in the initiative count.) Dragon's Dais. To the south, stone steps climb 10 feet to a dais, where Umbraxakar is perched. Statues. A double door at the back of the dais is flanked by two 20-foot-tall, black marble statues, one depicting Shar as a cloaked woman wielding a dagger in each hand and the other showing Halaster Blackcloak clutching a staff. The statues glare at one another like mortal enemies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SHADOW DRAGON</head><p>Umbraxakar is a Huge adult bronze dragon with the shadow dragon template, which causes the following changes to his statistics:</p><p>• Umbraxakar is neutral evil. He has resistance to necrotic damage. While in dim light or darkness, he has resistance to all damage that isn't force, psychic, or radiant, and he can take the Hide action as a bonus action. His Stealth skill modifier is +10. While in sunlight, he has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. His Lightning Breath becomes Shadow Breath, dealing necrotic damage instead of lightning damage. A humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this damage dies, and an undead shadow rises from its corpse and acts immediately after Umbraxakar in the initiative count. The shadow is under Umbraxakar's control.</p><p>Umbraxakar and the shadows under his command try to destroy intruders as quickly as possible, enabling the shadow dragon to revel in their misery rather than his own.</p><p>Umbraxakar 's Despair. While gifting one of these items, the character must speak sympathetic words to the dragon and succeed on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check. Other characters can't help on this check; it is made with advantage, however, if the character claims to be an emissary of House Moonstar or refers to the dragon by his true name, Glyster. If the character tries to deceive the dragon in any way, replace the Persuasion check with a DC 20 Charisma (Deception) check. On a failed check, the dragon is not swayed by the characters' words but still keeps the gift.</p><p>With each successful check, the dragon becomes visibly more conflicted as moonlight magically flickers across his scales, making them appear more solid and less translucent. A character who sees this magical moonlight can sense, with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Insight) check, that it's of divine origin. (The moonlight is a blessing from Se!One, though there's no way for the characters to confirm this.)</p><p>Three successful checks are needed to rid the dragon of his despair, whereupon he dismisses any remaining undead under his command, causing them to vanish and never return. His spirits lifted by the characters' gifts and words, Umbraxakar changes back into an adult bronze dragon, returns the characters' gifts, and insists on being called Glyster henceforth. He offers to help the characters clear out the rest ofVanrakdoom as well as to explore deeper levels of Undermountain in the hope of finding a gate that he can use to escape from Undermountain. Glyster would like to take his collected treasures with him (see area 33) and offers the characters a few choice items if they help him transport the hoard.</p><p>Glyster is an archetypal bronze dragon who likes to assume a variety of humanoid and beast forms. For roleplaying guidance, see the "Bronze Dragon" entry in the Monster Manual.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ALASTER MAKES HIS HOME IN THE LOWEST LEVEL</head><p>of Undermountain, which is optimized for four characters of 17th level or higher. Characters who defeat the monsters on this level s hould gain enough XP to reach 20th level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WHO DWELLS HERE?</head><p>In addition to Halaster, two of the Mad Mage's apprentices reside on this level: Arcturia and Trobriand.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HALASTER BLACKCLOAK</head><p>If the adventurers have made their way to this level, Halas ter is equal parts impressed and curious. He is ready to grant the characters a n audience, having kept an eye on their progress. True to the nature that earned him the moniker "Mad Mage," Halaster's demeanor toward the characters can change on a whim. He might alternate between seeming furious, baffled, annoyed, amused-or simply bored, depending on what the characters have accomplished before reaching this level. See appendix A for more information on the Mad Mage.</p><p>If the characters and their actions support Halaster's current goal (see "Halaster's Goals," page 11), the Mad Mage is not necessarily hostile. For example, if his primary goal is to find an apprentice, Halaster has kept an eye on a ny a rcane s pellcasters in the party. He might s uggest that those characters prove their worth by surviving the Mad Wizard's Lair and "freeing up" an apprenticeship by eliminating Arcturia or Trobriand. If this is done, Halas ter is willing to take on an appropriate character as a new apprentice. Halaster has no sentimental attachment toward his apprentices, and he often enjoys secretly tormenting them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARCTURIA</head><p>Arcturia is a lich and a master of transmutation magic. She has altered her form dramatically over the years, now appearing more alive than undead. Gossamer wings sprout from her shoulders, and bone spurs jut from her forearms and elbows.</p><p>If the characters destroyed her phylactery on level 14, Arcturia attacks them on sight. She has no beef with them otherwise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TROBRIAN D THE METAL MAGE</head><p>Trobriand specializes in the creation of magical constructs. Characters who have passed through the upper levels might have encountered some of his creations.</p><p>Fed up with the frailty of the flesh, Trobriand has transferred his spirit into the body of a specially prepared iron golem. This merging of spirit and metal has done nothing to improve his sanity, however.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE DUNGEON</head><p>Locations in the dungeon portion of this level (areas 1 through 21) a re keyed to map 23. No tunnels or staircases connect this dungeon complex to the upper levels of Undermountain. Characters arrive in area 1 after passing through a gate in Shadowdusk Hold (area 35 on level 22).</p><p>LEVEL 23 I MAD WIZARD'S L'\IR M11P 26: <ref type="bibr">SKULLPORT, UPPER LEVEL</ref> were destroyed or driven out during the Spellplague, leaving behind a bleak, three-story stone mansion that the Harpers have seized and turned into a hideout.</p><p>Felrax, a dragonborn mage with copper-colored scales, watches over the mansion. A light cantrip cast on his staff allows Felrax to see in the dark interior. If one or more characters are Harpers, Felrax offers to help them in one or both of the following ways:</p><p>• He a llows the party to use the mansion as a sanctuary and a resting place for as long as they need it. • If the characters need to leave Skullport in a hurry, he tells them that Tasselgryn Velldarn (area 27) has access to a teleportatioo circle and charges 50 gp per person for its use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="32.">DUMATHOI~EST</head><p>---Ygarra Urmbaalt, a duergar, appraises gemstones for a flat fee of 20 percent of a gem's value. Her establishment is a one-story, ugly stone building.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="33.">THE OVERFLOWING URN -----</head><p>This store rests atop another structure that is crumbling with age. As a result, the building tilts slightly to the east. Inside, a man calling himself Garryth sells flasks of oil for 5 sp each and casks of pitch for 2 gp each. Five years ago, a doppelganger killed Garryth and assumed his identity after disposing of the body. The doppelganger is content running the business and has no qualms about paying money to Xanathar for protection. The store is cluttered with more such goods, all labeled and clearly priced. The apothecary, Nightshade, is an undead creature (use the mummy statistics) that looks like a withered crone dressed in a tattered black robe.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="35.">THE WORM'S GULLET -----</head><p>The only restaurant in town is located inside a petrified, hollowed-out purple worm. The food and the service have gone downhill ever since Xanathar installed a new manager: a heartless duergar named Gharz Stonedark.</p><p>Gharz makes meals out of whatever his kobolds can find, and patrons are expected to eat whatever Gharz serves them. Common meals include stirge loaf, carrion crawler souffle, tlumph stew, and hot shrieker pie. The house ale is Wyrmwizz, straight from the local distillery (area 16). A meal with a drink costs 5 sp per person.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="36.">TANOR 1 THAL REFUGE ----</head><p>Carved by the drow of House Tanor'thal, this stronghold resembles an upside-down spider that looms above the rest of Skull port like a great, dark god. The spider's hollowed-out head, thorax, and abdomen contain windowless living quarters filled with thick webs and a host of giant spiders. Other denizens of Skullport avoid this place, making it an excellent refuge once the spiders are cleared out. The drow left nothing of value behind when they vacated their refuge. Special Equipment. Halaster wears a robe of eyes that lets him see in all directions, gives him darkvision out to a range of 120 feet, grants advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, and allows him to see invisible creatures and objects, as well as into the Ethereal Plane, out to a range of 120 feet.</p></div>
