# Motivation
2 months since my last update. I implemented the Fuzzy Logic engine but after playing around with it
it might not actually be that fun. I do want to keep some ideas like a diverse set of skills and
intersecting skills affecting the results. Now that I'm back in the US I want to focus on a prototype
I can introduce to some players. So a quick next steps might be:

1. Let the DM create new campaigns and encounters.
2. Let players create a named character.
3. Let the DM add some characters to an encounter.
4. Create an encounter UI where the players can control their characters on the map.
