# Motivation
2 months since my last update. I implemented the Fuzzy Logic engine but after playing around with it
it might not actually be that fun. I do want to keep some ideas like a diverse set of skills and
intersecting skills affecting the results. Now that I'm back in the US I want to focus on a prototype
I can introduce to some players. So a quick next steps might be:

1. Let the DM create new campaigns and encounters.
2. Let players create a named character.
3. Let the DM add some characters to an encounter.
4. Create an encounter UI where the players can control their characters on the map.

Now I've gotten sidetracked by implementing a CRUD service so you can the JSONRPC service methods
from an HTTP endpoint. Definitely making me think I should have just gone with Ruby on Rails. I also
futzed around with embedded structs and foreign keys in a manner that works, but it tedious whereas
ActiveRecord would have done it with almost zero effort. But then the server compiles, works and is
so much less complicated than all the middleware and monkey patching that Rails brings to the party.

## Checklist
These are all from the profile screen. Right now I'm implementing them as server-driven HTML forms
(thus the need for the HTTP endpoint), it might make sense to make them React components, especially
for editing.

1. [✓] Create a new campaign with a name and description
2. [✓] Create an encounter for the campaign with a name, description, and tilemap
3. [✓] Create a character
4. [ ] Add a character to the campaign
5. [ ] Add a character from the campaign to the encounter
6. [ ] Load the encounter and character(s) onto the tilemap.
