# RPG.ai
I was walking to the Hotel Beresford for my weekly D&D 5E session with some coworkers. I had been
running the Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage campaign for maybe a year by then, and the toil of
session prep and combat management was getting me down. I said to my friends:

"Wouldn't it be nice if there was an RPG where the computer took care of the hard stuff for you?"

And thus, RPG.ai was born.

# First Steps
If you wish to build a web-app, you must first... invent the Universe. Well, you don't have to, but
I decided to anyways. I strongly considered [Revel](https://revel.github.io/) because it looks
comprehensive and well-supported. In the end though, I decided to do it myself for complete control
over the application. I also really like Go's support for code generation. I've found the
combination of [SQLC](https://github.com/kyleconroy/sqlc) and
[Quick Templates](https://github.com/valyala/quicktemplate) to be very powerful. I even wrote my own
JSONRPC service generator so I could use the Go types in my Typescript. My day job is working on a
Rails app ([academia.edu](https://academia.edu)) and having everything be typed from the SQL on up
is exceedingly nice for quick development. It means I can edit an SQL query and get the compiler to
help me refactor the usages all the way up to the frontend. This means I don't need tests, and can
iterate faster. Not that I shouldn't ever have tests, they'll come later.

But you're probably not here to listen to me wax nostalgic about the state of web development, if
you really care about that stuff, the code for this site is all on
https://github.com/etherealmachine/rpg.ai, marvel at my mess.
