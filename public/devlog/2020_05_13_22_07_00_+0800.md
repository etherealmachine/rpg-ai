# RPG.ai
I was walking to the Hotel Beresford for my weekly D&D 5E session with some coworkers. I had been
running the Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage campaign for maybe a year by then, and the toil of
session prep and combat management was getting me down. I said to my friends:

"Wouldn't it be nice if there was an RPG where the computer took care of the hard stuff for you?"

And thus, RPG.ai was born.

# The Vision
I'm building RPG.ai because I want a tool to help me build worlds and tell stories with friends.
How do I think this website can accomplish that? Let me run down the problems I have running my
current D&D 5E campaign that led me to want RPG.ai:

First, let me list what's in a typical source book like [Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/waterdeep-dungeon-mad-mage) (DOTMM):

1. Maps
2. Room descriptions
3. Generic dungeon info
4. Encounter tables
5. NPC Descriptions
6. Adventure Hooks

Each map is lovingly filled out with dozens of rooms. My party is currently headed towards Level 10,
Muiral's Gauntlet. This map has 30 rooms, each with at least a paragraph description, some with
a full page. The room descriptions might mention NPCs or spells or references to adventure hooks. In
DOTMM the titular Mad Mage Halaster has left portals strewn about that link to other rooms on other
levels. To successfully describe a room I might need to jump between:

1. The map for the shape, plus how many exits/doors exist.
2. The description, for stuff to interact with, traps, etc.
3. The start of the chapter, which describes the NPC's motivations and attribute.

Then, when combat starts, I need to bring up:

1. An encouter map, or at least a quick sketch on a grid, to give the players a sense of physical
space.
2. An initiative tracker, and some way of tracking NPC stats and spells cast.
3. A spell reference, for when my players cast some spell with crazy effects and rules.
4. A monster reference, so I know the NPCs can do.

I made my https://etherealmachine.github.io/dnd5e-binder/ to help with quick referencing D&D 5E
material, but it's still hard to get everything in one place.

Finally, once combat is up and running it slows to a crawl as players try to figure out complex
rules like how much movement they have ("ok, I can bonus action dash, plus my regular movement, but
this is difficult terrain..."), and what abilities apply ("do I have advantage? then sneak attack
triggers, but only if I haven't used it this turn"). And throughout this I'm trying to do my best
to give some narrative to the mechanics - "a 16 to-hit still isn't enough, your sword (was it a
sword or a warhammer for this character, I can't remember) glances off his plate armor."

That last bit is the meat of RPG.ai. I want a system where the computer helps me do my job. For
me that means:

1. Converting mechanical results into a narrative explanation. The computer should run the numbers
then tell me what happened. I can describe the results to the players.
2. Rulings, not rules. I should be able to tweak the scales given some player input. This means
making it easy to give the players (or NPCs) bonuses and minuses based on evolving conditions. For
example, a player creatively kicks dirt into the monster's eye? Give it a -2 to-hit for a turn.
D&D 5E sort of lets you do this, but the advantage system is very mechanical. In 5E, DM discretion
is *allowed*, but rarely *encouraged*.
3. Having all my references in one place. I should be able to easily link between a room
description, trap details, NPC motivation, and NPC actions, on the same screen.

So far this is all about running a single session, but there's so much more I think we can do once
the system is in place:

1. Offer a nice editor for adding new maps, characters, rooms, and objects.
2. Make it easy to share this content with other DM's.
3. Use procedural generation to remix existing content that you can then drop into an existing
campaign.

That last bit is the key - I imagine a world where you can just run a session on the fly, using
procedural generation to expand the world based on where the players go and the DM's description.
E.g. if the players ask "is there a town nearby with a cleric that can cast X", you should be able
to drop in a map with a fully functioning town and a cleric with a rich backstory and motivations.

# The RPG.ai Game System
So RPG.ai is a mashup of old school pen-and-paper roleplaying and a computer RPG. What does that
mean? Primarily it means digital content. RPG.ai needs:

## Maps
Maps form the basis of an Encounter. Maps are populated with descriptions, objects, and NPC's.
RPG.ai maps are meant to be used like a handout in D&D. The map is a tool to help the imagination.

## Descriptions
Descriptions are "flavor text." They describe the location and give evocative details to flesh out
the scene. Descriptions can reference other content - NPC's, objects, spells. The user interface
can then helpfully bring these up when you read the description or the players enter the room.

For example:

> You enter a cramped room, strewn with the results of alchemy experiments. An old man ([Marius](#))
> is sitting at a desk, studying an [old tome](#).
<br />
> If the players enter [quietly](#): He doesn't appear to notice you enter.
<br />
> If the players enter [loudly](#): He looks up as you enter, it appears you startled him.

Where the links there to `Marius`, the `old tome`, and the terms `quietly` and `loudly` should link
to reference cards for those items. `quietly` and `loudly` should also be able to look up the last
few stealth rolls the players made, or maybe actions made in the last room, and remind the DM - does
it look like the players are being quiet or loud?

## Objects
Objects are pre-defined things the players might want to interact with on the map. For example, a
trapped chest with some loot or a lever that opens a secret door. Objects shouldn't limit what the
players can do though - if the description says there's a table in the room and the players
want to turn the table into a barricade, it should be easy to spawn a table object with some stats.
The room description must be able to easily reference objects, and the reference can then bring up
stats and a further description of the object itself.

## NPCs
NPC's should work the same way objects do. The difference is NPCs represent living, breathing
characters, so they need a name, a backstory, relationships, and possessions. Furthermore, the AI
should be able to link these into your specific campaign. Make a custom NPC for a map? Maybe his
sister shows up later in an auto-generated encounter.

Hopefully this gives you a sense of the vision I have for RPG.ai. It's a lot of complicated content
that I hope adds up to a simple experience of sitting down telling fantastic stories with friends.
