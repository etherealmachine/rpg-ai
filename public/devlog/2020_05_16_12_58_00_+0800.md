# Mechanic Ideas
While I'm [reinventing a web app](/devlog/first-steps) I might as well invent a new RPG system to
go along with it! Here are my preliminary ideas for some interesting mechanics for RPG.ai:

## Fuzzy Logic
[Fuzzy Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic) is a way to use "linguistic variables" to
craft rules that can be executed and turned into real numbers. For example:

> If `training` is `highly trained` and `innate ability` is `good` then `chance of success` is `high`
<br />
> If `training` is `untrained` and `innate ability` is `mediocre` then `chance of success` is `low`
<br />
> If `training` is `untrained` and `innate ability` is `low` then `chance of success` is `very low`
<br />
> If `experience` is `high` and `training` is `a few lessons` then `chance of success` is `medium`

So basically, you take a real number, then map it to some fuzzy sets. For example, if `training = 0.2`
this might correspond with `untrained = 0.7` and `highly trained = 0.1`. You're not totally untrained,
and you're also a little highly trained. Then you can run the fuzzy rules and get back a real-numbered value,
`chance of success = 0.3`. So we can interpret this as a 30% chance of success. Roll a D20 (feels so
much better than a percentile die) and compare to see if you success or fail.

My idea with using fuzzy logic is two-fold: First, you can use regular English to define the rules,
including letting the DM add rules as needed. Fuzzy logic does pretty well at producing smooth
output so you can more safely modify the ruleset without risking introducing broken rules. Second,
it highly discourages min-maxing. The rules are readable by humans, but interpreting them all and
trying to optimize the output exactly becomes a little difficult. The intent here is to make the
decision of "should I train this skill, or that one" be a matter of your _characters_ wishes, rather
than a mechanical decision ("no one takes X, it isn't worth it).

Finally, there's a hidden third reason I want to try fuzzy logic in an RPG system: It must be done
with a computer. Technically you could run the rules yourself, the math isn't complicated, but
there's just so _much_ of it. I think that using mechanics that must be automated might make for an
interesting, unique system, setting RPG.ai apart and giving players and DMs a reason to try it out.

## Skills
Skills should be multi-faceted and plentiful. My idea here is to take a queue from the Elder Scrolls
games, where using a skill improves your ability in said skill. Current thoughts are separating
`innate ability` from `training` and `experience`. So your character might be naturally gifted in a
skill, making training and experience easier. Or their background might include some training and
experience, making up for a lack of innate ability.

I want to have lots of skills, covering as many concievable things you might want to do as possible.
Skill checks should consist of the player and DM selecting a set of skills that apply to a given
situation. I specifically want to avoid the D&D 5E mechanics around something like climbing where
you can use either your athletics or your acrobatics skills. Why not both? Although in this case I
imaging skills would be targeted at trainable actions - so climbing, running, lifting, jumping, are
all skills, and maybe climbing and jumping would apply in a skill check.

I also want to shy away from abilities and experience points. Your race and initial character build
should include some abilities that affect the innate ability for all skills. But these shouldn't
really define or limit your character. Maybe half-orcs have a higher default innate ability for
strength-based skills, but that should be overcome with training and experience.

No experience pointsâ€½ You improve your character by gaining experience with skills, training them,
and getting new and better items and spells. Ideally the computer tracks the skills you used during
a session, then the DM reviews this and you get a nice summary of how you "leveled up" certain
skills.

## Items
Items should also be multi-faceted and plentiful, as well as link into skills. For example, do you
want to be good at using a sword and shield combo? You'll need to acquire both, and the combo might
be a specific skill you need to train. A Roman-style Gladius with a Scutum is its own specific
melee-based skill. This skill might start as "some experience" because you already have some melee
experience. Items should be able to be based off of templates/prototypes, but then easily customized
for both the DM and players, to give the world depth and character. It's not just a "longsword."
It's a "rusty bronze longsword" and the rusty part should affect how effective it cuts, the bronze
part how valuable it is if you want to sell it.

Further customization should be done with magic items. I also really dislike how magic item creation
got dropped from D&D 5E. It should be totally possible for the players to propose a new item,
including magic items, along with rules for that item. After a quick DM review, these can be added
to the game, possibly auto-generating some properties based on other, similar items. Then, the item
can be shared globally for use in other campaigns.

## Spells
Along with customizable items, spells should be customizable too. I'd also like more spells, so
casters can specalize better and let that specializatio affect casting. For example, `evocation` is
a _skill_, which can be trained and leveled up like any other. A highly skilled `evocation` mage
should be able to cast a devastating Fireball, but his Circle of Protection is going to suffer
because of his lack of experience with `abjuration`.

## NPC Dispositions
The current state on Roll20: You're listening to your DM on Discord. He says

> the apothecary is named <mdfghd..>, he seems grumpy, it's 5am and you've just woken him up for the
> second time in a week asking for healing herbs".

You can't hear his name, because it's spelled weird and Discord. You've also forgotten about what
you said last week, because it was literally a week ago in the last session.

The answer: On your screen, you get a nice character card. The card has an image (the DM just typed
in "wise old man" and grabbed something that looked good), a disposition, and some events. The
disposition is provided by the DM, maybe modified by the events. The events show a summary of all
your past interactions, explaining why he's so grumpy. The disposition is going to get used for any
checks that get made - e.g. "If `disposition` is `grumpy` then `chance of success` is `low`." If you
want to ask him a favor, you might want to try to change his disposition first. Of course, you can
also just try intimidating him - "If `disposition` is `scared` then `chance of success` is
`medium`." Note that fuzzy logic means he's BOTH here: he's some fraction grumpy and also some
fraction scared, plus a dozen other emotions, all affecting the outcome. Furthermore, his DM card
links to some friends and relatives. When you scare him, the DM goes and easily makes the
disposition of his connections towards you a little more `hostile` (plus a nice event explaining
why for when you talk to them later).

## Combat

### Stamina, Focus, and Faith
Finally, a bit of combat (hey, you just made the town more `hostile` towards you, it's their fault).
I want to take a key from [Fallout: Tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_Tactics:_Brotherhood_of_Steel)
and use something similar to action points. Your character gets some number of points each turn to
spend on actions, taken from a pool that can only be refreshed by resting. Using items, casting
spells, running around, all take varying amounts of points, and you get to decide how to spend
those points and how many to spend. These would also be fuzzy logic based, e.g.

> If `weapon` is `heavy` then `stamina used` is `high`
<br />
> If `stamina` is `low` then `weapon damage` is `low`
<br />
> If `focus used` is `high` then `spell damage` is `high`
<br />
> if `focus left` is `low` then `spell damage` is `low`

So your choice of weapon/spell matters, your choice to drain all your Stamina earlier matters, the
time you took to tell the DM you prayed for help from your god(s) this morning matters ("If `faith`
is `high` then `healing` is `high`", you remembered to pray, right?).
