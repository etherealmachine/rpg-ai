# First Steps
Note: Those not interested in web app design might want to skip ahead to [Mechanic Ideas](/devlog/mechanic-ideas).

If you wish to build a web-app, you must first... invent the Universe. Well, you don't have to, but
I decided to anyways. I strongly considered [Revel](https://revel.github.io/) because it looks
comprehensive and well-supported. In the end though, I decided to do it myself for complete control
over the application. [Write Libraries, Not Frameworks](https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/blog/libraries-not-frameworks)
is also a good article on the topic. As you can see from my last post, I'm also going to be building
a role-playing system from scratch, so rolling a custom webapp is par for the course.

RPG.ai leans heavily on the awesome Go library ecosystem. [Gorilla](https://www.gorillatoolkit.org/)
provides basic HTTP router functionality, and the `csrf` and `sessions` modules are critical for
security and authentication. I'm not foolhardy enough to try to roll my own auth. [SQLC](https://github.com/kyleconroy/sqlc)
and [Quick Templates](https://github.com/valyala/quicktemplate) use Go's code generation to let me
write in a domain specific language (SQL and HTML), then generate nicely typed Gocode from that. I
even wrote my own JSONRPC service generator so I could use the Go types in my Typescript.
[React](https://reactjs.org/) on the frontend performs a similar role - write HTML, produce
Javascript. My day job is working on a Rails app ([academia.edu](https://academia.edu)) so I
absolutely appreciate having everything be typed from the SQL on up in my pet project. It means I
can edit an SQL query and get the compiler to help me refactor all the way up to the frontend. This
means I don't need tests and can iterate faster. Not that I shouldn't ever have
tests, they'll come later.

Here's a quick request dataflow diagram I made:

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
  <img style="width: 100%" src="/images/request-dataflow.svg" />
</div>

First, all requests go through three pieces of middleware - `RedirectToHTTPS`, `CSRF`, and
`GetAuthenticatedSession`. `RedirectToHTTPS` does what is says on the tin, any non-https requests
get redirected. I don't go so far as to implement [HSTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security).
I use Google and Facebook oAuth as the only supported means of logging in, and both require secure
cookies, plus Heroku provides free certificates for apps by default, so it's easy to just pipe
everything through HTTPS. `CSRF` uses Gorilla to check the [cross-site request forgery](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf)
token. My plain HTML forms set the CSRF token in a hidden field, while AJAX calls have an [endpoint
they can hit](https://medium.com/@iaincollins/csrf-tokens-via-ajax-a885c7305d4a) to request a token
that gets added in a header of the JSONRPC requests. `GetAuthenticatedSession` is part of the
authentication flow - it checks the secure session cookie to see if the user is logged in. If so, it
adds a User object to the request's [context](https://golang.org/pkg/context/), which lets future
controllers easily get the logged in user.

The final two middleware are context specific. API requests get `SetAuthenticatedSession`, which is
a little wierd. It checks to see if the API request logged the user in by setting the secure session
cookie. The reason it's odd is because it records the HTTP response for playback. This is because
Gorilla doesn't provide a method for setting cookies from a JSONRPC request. This is also a good
example of libraries versus frameworks. Gorilla here is being a bit frameworky and doing some
reflection to automatically hook up my JSONRPC services. In return I get well-typed services, but
sacrifice some control over the request flow. An alternative to all this would be just POSTing login
requests, but I wanted to avoid redirects while logging in. I probably will end up implementing a
simple post-based login form in the future.

Finally, some requests go through `LoginRequired`, which justs redirects you if
`GetAuthenticatedSession` hasn't found a valid session cookie. It should probably redirect to that
post-based login form I should build. Note that JSONRPC requests don't get `LoginRequired`. Instead,
each request has to implement an authentication check if required. Gorilla lets you register
[interceptors](https://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/rpc#Server.RegisterInterceptFunc), but it's not
clear to me how to use those to change the returned value (e.g. return an authentication required
error). For now, manually authenticating in JSONRPC services mostly works fine because for any
requests that need authentication, I also need a valid user ID that I can only get by getting the
authenticated user, so it acts as a safe-guard.

Once requests have made it though the gauntlet, they can finally be serviced by a controller. These
work exactly like Rails or Django controllers - grab some data from the database, change it a bit,
stuff it into a template. I heavily rely on SQLC to make the database part of that rely on SQL as
much as possible, including authorized user checks - e.g. the SQL for updating a tilemap checks that
you actually own the tilemap you're trying to update. The JSONRPC endpoints are also basically just
controllers that stuff data into a JSON response (again, nicely typed because of autogenerated .ts
files).

There's a few other neat bits, like how the app reads and parses the index.html file built by
Webpack to fill in the CSS and JS dependencies, or how this very post is read in as Markdown then
piped to the browser as HTML. But you're probably not here to listen to me wax nostalgic about the
state of web development. If you really care about all this stuff, the code for this site is on
Github as  https://github.com/etherealmachine/rpg.ai, marvel at my mess.
