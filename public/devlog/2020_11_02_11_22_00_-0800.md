# M Something Manor

## Setup
An anonymous buyer has contacted you with a request - steal a magical artifact from his mansion in
the country. The job pays well, 40,000 gold split 4 ways, but the job might be difficult. The buyer
tells you the target is a mage, he's retired from the guild but continues to his research. The house
has several servants to get past and probably a few magical protections besides that.

Furthering the difficulty, the house is in the country. There's a small village nearby with an Inn
but a group of outsiders will standout. Word spreads fast in the country so you'll either want a
cover story or to stay clear of the town entirely. Of course the woods that far out aren't the
safest spot. Anyways, case the manor, find a way in, grab the artifact, and get out of there.
